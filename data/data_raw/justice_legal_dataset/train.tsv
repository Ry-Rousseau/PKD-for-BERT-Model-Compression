0	on august 10, 2003, germaine rucker was shot and killed. kentel myrone weaver later admitted to shooting rucker after the police questioned him. during jury selection for weaver’s trial, the court officer closed the court to weaver’s family and other members of the public due to overcrowding. weaver was subsequently convicted of murder in the first degree. in 2011, weaver filed a motion for a new trial and claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to object to the closure of the courtroom in violation of his sixth amendment right to a public trial.the trial court denied weaver’s motion. on direct appeal, the supreme judicial court of massachusetts affirmed weaver’s conviction. the court held that weaver had not shown that he suffered prejudice from his counsel’s failure to object to the court closure. although a sixth amendment violation typically constitutes a “structural error,” which is automatically presumed to be prejudicial, the court held that, when the structural error resulted from alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that he suffered prejudice.

1	during the 2004 presidential campaign, president george w. bush's team scheduled a campaign stop in jacksonville, oregon. with the approval of local law enforcement agencies, opponents of president bush organized a peaceful demonstration to protest his policies. the demonstration took place at a public park before moving to the street near the local inn where the president was staying. eventually, both opponents and supporters of president bush gathered on the street of near the entrance to the inn, and each group had equal access to deliver its message to the president at the time of his arrival. before the president arrived, secret service agents ordered local police to push protestors away from the immediate area for security reasons. the agents then ordered that the protesters be driven farther away from the inn onto the east side of 5th street. however, agents failed to give the same directive for supporters who remained stationed on the streets close to the inn. the plaintiffs alleged that the orders to move were unintelligibly given and that police proceeded to use force before confirming that the orders were understood or were being followed.

2	"charles richmond worked as a welder at the navy public works center in san diego, california until 1981, when the office of personnel management (opm) approved his application to for a disability retirement. opm determined that richmond’s poor eyesight prevented him from performing his job and entitled him to receive the benefits for disabled federal employees who have completed five years of service. before 1982, an individual was ineligible for disability benefits if, in each of the two succeeding calendar years, the individual earns at least 80 percent of the current pay of the position occupied immediately prior to retirement. in 1982, this requirement was amended so that an individual becomes ineligible if he earns at least 80 percent of the pay of the previous position in any succeeding calendar year. until 1985, richmond worked part time and his earnings were low enough to keep him eligible for disability benefits. in 1985, he had the opportunity to earn more money, so he contacted opm to make sure he would remain eligible. opm provided him with the old requirements but not the new ones. richmond subsequently accepted overtime work, earned more, and became ineligible for disability benefits. he lost six months of disability pay.
richmond appealed the denial of benefits to the merit systems protection board (mspb) and argued that the fact that he received incorrect information from opm prevented them from denying his benefits. the mspb denied richmond’s appeal for review. richmond appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit, which reversed the decision."

4	 republic steel corporation, international harvester company, and interlake iron corporation operated steel mills on the banks on the calumet river.  their manufacturing processes produced industrial waste.  water containing waste was recycled back into the river.  most of the solid waste was separated and disposed of, but liquid and small particles were dumped into the river.  over time, these small particles reduced the river depth from 21 feet to less than 9 feet in some places.  the rivers and waters act prohibits the “creation of any obstruction....to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the united states.”  the statue does allow for certain exceptions authorized by the secretary of the army.  the united states sued the steel companies for creating an obstruction by dumping their industrial waste.  the district court granted an injunction.  the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit reversed, holding that the waste deposits did not constitute an “obstruction” under the act and even if it did, an injunction was not permitted.

6	"warren summerlin killed a loan collector with a hatchet in 1982 and was subsequently convicted of murder. he was sentenced to death by a state trial judge because of the heinous nature of the crime and his previous criminal history. he appealed the sentence, arguing that his attorney's romantic relationship with the prosecutor and the trial judge's proven use of marijuana had prevented him from receiving a fair trial, but the arizona state courts rejected his appeals.
in june 2002, however, the u.s. supreme court issued its decision in ring v. arizona. the decision found that the sixth amendment right to jury trial meant that only juries, not judges, could sentence someone to death. the ring decision gave summerlin new hope. he appealed his conviction, arguing that the decision changed the substance of the law rather than just the procedure used to apply it, and that it should therefore be applied retroactively. the state countered that the change dealt only with who did the actual sentencing, not with the burden of proof, and was therefore only procedural. because procedural changes are not applied retroactively under the supreme court's 1989 decision in teague v. lane, the state argued that summerlin's sentence should be upheld. a divided ninth circuit court of appeals disagreed, siding instead with summerlin and ordering the state to reopen his trial for re-sentencing."

9	in 1989, the u.s. supreme court held that johnny paul penry had been sentenced to death in violation of the eighth amendment after finding that texas' special issues questions did not permit the jury to consider mitigating evidence involving his mental retardation. on retrial in 1990, penry was again found guilty of capital murder. the defense again put on extensive evidence regarding penry's mental impairments. ultimately, a psychiatric evaluation, which stated that penry would be dangerous to others if released, prepared at the request of penry's former counsel, was cited. upon submission to the jury, the trial judge instructed the jury to determine penry's sentence by answering the same special issues in the original penry case. additionally, the trial judge gave a supplemental instruction on mitigating evidence. the court sentenced penry to death in accordance with the jury's answers to the special issues. in affirming, the texas court of criminal appeals rejected penry's claims that the admission of language from the psychiatric evaluation violated his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and that the jury instructions were constitutionally inadequate because they did not permit the jury to consider and give effect to his particular mitigating evidence. penry's petitions for state and federal habeas corpus relief failed.

14	"in 1997 vermont passed a campaign finance law, act 64, which imposed strict limits both on expenditures by candidates for office during the election cycle and on the contributions of individuals, political groups, and parties. neil randall, a state legislator, sued vermont attorney general william sorrell, arguing that the limits were unconstitutional infringements on first amendment freedom of speech. in randall's view, the supreme court had declared all expenditure limits unconstitutional in buckley v. valeo, and act 64's contribution limits were unconstitutionally low. sorrell countered that buckley was outmoded because that court had not considered one of vermont's justifications, namely that expenditure limits prevent candidates from spending too much time trying to raise money. sorrell also argued that vermont's interests in combating corruption and ensuring fair elections justified the contribution limits. the district court struck down the expenditure limits, but upheld most of the contribution limits. only the limits on contributions by political parties - under which national, state, and local parties together could give only $400 to a statewide candidate - were unconstitutionally low. both parties appealed the ruling to the second circuit court of appeals. the circuit court reversed, ruling that all of vermont's contribution limits were constitutional. the second circuit also found that the expenditure limits would be constitutional as long as they were ""narrowly tailored"" to the state's interests."

the wynnes appealed to the maryland tax court and argued that the limitation violated the dormant commerce clause of the constitution. the tax court rejected the wynnes' argument and affirmed the revised assessment. the wynnes then appealed to the maryland circuit court for howard county. the circuit court reversed the tax court's decision and held that the county tax without a credit violated the dormant commerce clause. the comptroller appealed to the maryland court of appeals and argued that the commerce clause was not implicated by the county tax. the maryland court of appeals affirmed the circuit court by finding that the county tax implicates the dormant commerce clause because it affects the interstate market for capital and business investment and the overlapping power to tax income from such sources. the maryland court of appeals held that the county tax without a credit violated the commerce clause because the county tax is not fairly apportioned, since taxpayers who earn income from interstate activities would be taxed at higher rates than taxpayers who earn income exclusively in maryland while the tax covers income earned wholly outside of maryland. the maryland court of appeals also held that the county tax is discriminatory against interstate commerce since it favors businesses that do business primarily in maryland."

the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed the lower court and struck down the protect act as unconstitutionally overbroad. the eleventh circuit was unmoved by the government's argument that prosecuting the promotion of virtual child pornography as real is necessary to combat the child porn market. the circuit court held that the act's prohibition was broad enough to include any ""braggart, exaggerator, or outright liar"" who claims in a non-commercial context to have child pornography but actually does not. thus, the act's pandering provision prohibited protected speech as well as actual child pornography."

39	"michael crawford stabbed a man he claimed tried to rape his wife. during crawford's trial, prosecutors played for the jury his wife's tape-recorded statement to the police describing the stabbing. the statement contradicted crawford's argument that he stabbed the man in defense of his wife. because it was pre-recorded, crawford could not cross-examine the statement. the jury convicted crawford for assault.
crawford claimed the playing of his wife's statement, with no chance for cross-examination, violated the sixth amendment guarantee that ""[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right...to be confronted with the witnesses against him."" the state supreme court upheld the conviction, relying on the u.s. supreme court's decision in ohio v. roberts (1980). that decision allowed the admission of out-of-court testimony against a defendant if that testimony was reliable."

the railroad cooperated because it thought the act imposed unnecessary costs via the purchase of additional railroad cars. when plessy was told to vacate the whites-only car, he refused and was arrested. 
at trial, plessy’s lawyers argued that the separate car act violated the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments. the judge found that louisiana could enforce this law insofar as it affected railroads within its boundaries. plessy was convicted."	False

plaintiffs sue evenwel and edward pfenniger are registered texas voters who sued and claimed that the interim plan that was adopted and signed into law violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. they argued that the new districts do not adhere to the 'one person, one vote' principle, which the supreme court had previously held exists in the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment, because they were apportioned based on total population rather than registered voter population, and while the new districts are relatively equal in terms of total population, they vary wildly in relation to total voter population. the district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and held that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim based on equal protection clause jurisprudence, which allows total population to be the basis for district apportionment. the supreme court noted probable jurisdiction on the appeal."

51	"the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992 restructured the system for providing private health care benefits to coal industry retirees by merging two previous benefits plans into the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund. the fund is financed by annual premiums assessed against signatory coal operators, or those who signed any agreement requiring contributions to the plans that were merged into the fund. if the signatory is no longer in business, the act assigns liability for beneficiaries to a defined group of ""related persons"" based on the commissioner of social security assignments. shortly after jericol mining co. was formed in 1973 as irdell mining, inc., irdell purchased the coal mining operating assets of shackleford coal co., which was a signatory to a coal wage agreement while it was in business. between 1993 and 1997, the commissioner assigned responsibility for 86 retired miners to jericol, determining that as a successor in interest to shackleford, jericol qualified as a related person. all of these retirees had worked for shackleford, but none of them had actually worked for jericol. jericol filed suit against the commissioner. the district court granted jericol summary judgment, concluding that the act's classification regime does not provide for the liability of successors of defunct signatory operators. in affirming, the court of appeals concluded that jericol was not a related person to shackleford and thus could not be held responsible for shackleford's miners."

55	"individual voters in texas, along with organizations representing latinos and african americans, filed a number of lawsuits in 2011, challenging the texas legislature’s congressional and state house redistricting plans. the actions were consolidated and proceed in the u.s. district court for the western district of texas (“texas district court”). the plaintiffs alleged racial gerrymandering in violation of § 2 of the voting rights act (vra) as well as the 14th and 15th amendments to the united states constitution. at that time texas was bound by the preclearance requirements under § 5 of the vra, and therefore the state simultaneously filed an action in the u.s. district court for the district of columbia (“d.c. district court”) seeking preclearance of the redistricting plans. 
while trial proceedings were pending in both district courts, the 2012 primary elections were approaching. as a result, the texas district court assumed the task of implementing interim redistricting plans, which it did on an expedited basis, without access to all relevant facts, and with the understanding that most parties to the litigation alleged that those plans contained many of the same statutory and constitutional infirmities as the challenged plans. the u.s. supreme court vacated the first iteration of the interim maps on the grounds that the court had not been sufficiently deferential to the legislature; the texas district court issued more deferential plans in february 2012. 
the d.c. district court subsequently denied preclearance to the proposed redistricting plans on the basis that they were enacted with discriminatory intent and had the effect of abridging minority voting rights. texas appealed this decision to the u.s. supreme court.
after the texas district court’s interim maps were used for the 2012 elections, the texas legislature failed to take any action on redistricting in the 2013 regular session. however, it convened a special session during which it adopted, among others, the texas district court’s congressional interim map (“plan c235”) without any changes. the governor subsequently signed the legislation adopting this plan.
in june 2013, the u.s. supreme court decided shelby county v. holder, which removed the § 5 preclearance requirements from the vra. texas was therefore no longer automatically subject to preclearance requirements, and the u.s. supreme court later vacated and remanded for further proceedings the d.c. district court’s preclearance decision, which the lower court then dismissed as moot.
the defendants subsequently sought to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims in the texas district court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the case had become moot. in response, the plaintiffs expressed their desire to amend their complaints regarding the 2011 plans and to challenge the 2013 plans. the court granted them leave to amend, and denied the state’s motions to dismiss. the court explained that the plaintiffs’ claims regarding the 2011 plans were not moot because, inter alia, the plaintiffs continued to be harmed by them. the court also ordered that the 2013 plans, which included plan c235, be used for the 2014 elections. the plaintiffs then filed their amended complaints, including claims related to both the 2011 and 2013 plans. most plaintiffs included claims that plan c235 violated § 2 of the vra and the 14th and 15th amendments.
the texas district court held trials on the 2011 plans in 2014, and found that they violated certain aspects of § 2 of the vra and the 14th amendment. in the ongoing litigation, the plaintiffs contended that the 2013 plans, including plan c235, included some of the same elements that the court determined were the result of discriminatory intent or statutory or constitutional violations as in the 2011 plans.
in august 2017, the texas district court issued an interlocutory order regarding the plaintiffs’ c235 claims. it found that the racially discriminatory intent and effects identified in the 2011 plans carried through to the 2013 plans where the redistricting lines remained the same. it explained that the legislature had adopted the court’s interim plans (which included c235) as part of a litigation strategy that was designed to insulate the plans from any further challenge. the legislature had not engaged in any deliberative process to remove the discriminatory elements from the plans before adopting them, but instead intentionally furthered and continued the discrimination in the existing plans.
the court also concluded that the configurations of cd 27 and cd 35 under plan c235 violated § 2 of the vra and the 14th amendment. as to cd 27, though the court had found in 2012 that this district did not reflect a racially discriminatory purpose because it was not possible to create an additional latino opportunity district in the region, the texas legislature had still engaged in vote dilution. regarding cd 35, the court stated that while c235 was enacted in 2013, the challenged district boundaries that it reflected were drawn in 2011 and found to violate § 2 of the vra and the 14th amendment. the court explained that the texas legislature did not engage in any meaningful effort to cleanse the discriminatory elements from the 2013 plan before it was adopted, and in fact intended to maintain that discrimination in enacting the plan in substantially the same form. 
the court additionally found that the plaintiffs had proven a § 2 “results” violation as to cd 27, hd 32, and hd 34, and a racial gerrymandering claim as to hd 90.
the court’s order directed the texas attorney general to issue a written advisory within three days as to whether the legislature would convene a special session to address the issue of redistricting. if the legislature did not plan to hold a special session, the parties were ordered to appear before the court to prepare remedial redistricting plans.

the federal district court found for county and the district and held that there was no evidence that they were directly responsible. the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld the district court's decision with respect to the santa clara river and the malibu creek but reversed the decision with respect to the san gabriel river and the los angeles river."

the plan is governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa), which allows plan administrators to recover overpayment from a beneficiary when the recovery would constitute “appropriate equitable relief”. the trial court held that the terms of the plan required montanile to repay the initial $120,000, and that this repayment was appropriate equitable relief in part because the plan was able to identify a source of funds within montanile’s possession—the $500,000 settlement. montanile appealed and claimed that the repayment would not be equitable relief because the settlement had been spent or disbursed to other parties. the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit held that, because the plan had a right to reimbursement, the plan’s lien against montanile’s $500,000 settlement attached before montanile spent or disbursed the funds. therefore, montanile could not evade the repayment by claiming the settlement funds had been spent or disbursed."

108	a california court convicted kenneth roy of robbery and first-degree murder. the state argued that roy, in coming to the aid of a confederate who was committing the robbery, helped with the murder. the jury had been instructed that it could convict if roy, with knowledge of the confederate's unlawful purpose, had helped the confederate. the state supreme court later held an identical instruction erroneous because it did not require the jury to find that a defendant had the knowledge and intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the confederate's crime. the state court of appeal affirmed roy's conviction, finding that the error was harmless. on federal habeas review, the federal district court also found the error harmless, reasoning that no rational juror could have found that roy knew the confederate's purpose and helped him but also did not intend to help him. in reversing, the en banc court of appeals applied a special harmless-error standard and held that the omission of the instruction's intent part is harmless only if a review of the assistance and knowledge facts found by the jury establishes that the jury necessarily found the omitted intent element.

in 2005, jimenez filed a habeas corpus petition in a texas federal court arguing that he had not received adequate legal assistance during his proceedings in the state courts. the district judge dismissed the claim, holding that the one-year statute of limitations, which began running on the date of conviction, had expired. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit also denied jimenez's appeal. jimenez, in his petition for certiorari, argued that the one-year statute of limitations should actually have begun in 2005, after his final appeal was denied in state court, rather than in 1995 when he was convicted."

in 2017, the federal energy regulatory commission granted atlantic coast pipeline llc (atlantic) authorization to construct, operate, and maintain a natural gas pipeline that would cross the appalachian trail at points located within the george washington and monogahela national forests. after a review process, the forest service authorized atlantic to proceed with construction of the pipeline, finding it had authority under the mineral leasing act to grant a right-of-way for the pipeline and that the pipeline “would have no long lasting impacts” on the trail.

on appeal, the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed, holding that that the concept of willfulness includes ""reckless disregard"" for the law as well as actual knowledge that the conduct was illegal. the ruling put the ninth circuit in conflict with most other circuit courts, but the court argued that its interpretation was more consistent with supreme court precedent and the purpose of the fcra."

128	"amid intense public interest, congress passed the patient protection and affordable care act (aca), which became effective march 23, 2010. the aca sought to address the fact that millions of americans had no health insurance, yet actively participated in the health care market, consuming health care services for which they did not pay.
the aca contained a minimum coverage provision by amending the tax code and providing an individual mandate, stipulating that by 2014, non-exempt individuals who failed to purchase and maintain a minimum level of health insurance must pay a tax penalty. the aca also contained an expansion of medicaid, which states had to accept in order to receive federal funds for medicaid, and an employer mandate to obtain health coverage for employees.
shortly after congress passed the aca, florida and 12 other states brought actions in the united states district court for the northern district of florida seeking a declaration that the aca was unconstitutional on several grounds. these states were subsequently joined by 13 additional states, the national federation of independent businesses, and individual plaintiffs kaj ahburg and mary brown.
the plaintiffs argued that: (1) the individual mandate exceeded congress' enumerated powers under the commerce clause; (2) the medicaid expansions were unconstitutionally coercive; and (3) the employer mandate impermissibly interfered with state sovereignty.
the district court first addressed whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit. it determined that brown had standing to challenge the minimum coverage provision because she did not have health insurance and had to make financial arrangements to ensure compliance with the provision, which would go into effect in 2014. the court further determined that idaho and utah had standing because each state had enacted a statute purporting to exempt their residents from the minimum coverage provision.
the court also concluded that the anti-injunction act did not bar the suit.
the district court then addressed the constitutional questions. it ruled that the individual mandate provision was not a valid exercise of congress' commerce or taxing powers. the court held the entire act invalid because the mandate could not be severed from any other provision. the court dismissed the states' challenge to the employer mandates and granted judgment to the federal government on the medicaid expansions, finding insufficient support for the contention that the spending legislation was unconstitutionally coercive.
a panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed 2-to-1 the district court's holdings as to the medicaid expansions and the individual mandate. but it also reversed the district court, holding that the individual mandate could be severed without invalidating the remainder of the aca."

the school district appealed the order in an oregon federal district court arguing that reimbursement was not appropriate because t.a. unilaterally withdrew from school, never received special education services while enrolled, and withdrew for reasons unrelated to his learning disability. the district court invalidated the order. on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the district court and upheld the order. it reasoned that idea provided the courts broad discretion in order to achieve ""equitable relief"" for disabled students, including reimbursement for private school tuition."

in the spring of 1979, michael panico, who was considered to be “handicapped” under the meaning of the act, was attending memorial school, a public school in burlington. his continued poor performance and the school’s inability to handle his needs led to a discussion between the school district and michael’s parents about what changes needed to be made to his iep. in june of 1979, the town presented the panicos with an iep that called for michael to be placed at pine glen school. in the meantime, the panicos had met with specialists at the massachusetts general hospital who recommended that michael’s needs could best be served at the carroll school in lincoln, massachusetts. the panicos enrolled michael at the carroll school at their own expense.
the massachusetts department of education’s bureau of special education appeals (bsea) held several hearings on the issue and determined that the town’s proposed placement was inappropriate and that the carroll school was most adequately equipped to meet michael’s needs. the bsea ordered the town to pay for michael’s tuition and transportation, as well as reimburse the panicos for money already spent. the town sought judicial review in district court under federal and state statutes. the district court granted summary judgment against the town on the state law claim and set a date for trial on the federal claim. because the town had refused to comply with the bsea order, the panicos and the state moved for preliminary injunctive relief. the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit reversed the judgment in regards to the state law claim and held that none of the parties were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief because none could show irreparable injury. on remand, the district court found in favor of the town that the proposed iep was appropriate and that the town should not be required to compensate the panicos. the case was transferred to a different district judge to rule on the issue of whether or not the town should be required to pay the panicos for costs incurred while the case was pending. the district court held that the panicos’ decision to place michael in the carroll school without the town’s consent absolved the town of financial responsibility while the case was pending and ordered the panicos to reimburse the town. the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit reversed and held that the district court erred in conducting an entirely new trial, gave insufficient weight to the bsea findings, and did not properly evaluate the iep in question."

eventually, a herdsman who worked for the kozminskis became concerned for the welfare of fulmer and molitoris and alerted the authorities. county officials removed the men, and the kozminskis were tried in federal district court for holding fulmer and molitoris in involuntary servitude. based on jury instructions that included forms of coercion other than purely physical, the jury found the kozminskis guilty. the court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed the convictions on the grounds that the district court’s definition of involuntary servitude was too broad."

hall petitioned the supreme court of florida for habeas corpus relief based on the supreme court decision in hitchcock v. dugger, which held that all mitigating factors should be considered rather than just the mitigating factors listed in the relevant statutes. the supreme court of florida denied the petition and held that no error occurred in sentencing. after the governor signed his second death warrant, hall filed a motion to vacate the sentence, which the trial court denied by holding that the supreme court of florida's decision barred further review of the case. the supreme court of florida disagreed and held that the case involved additional non-record facts that had not been considered in the previous review. the case was vacated and remanded for new sentencing. at the new sentencing trial, the trial court held that hall's mental retardation was a mitigating factor with ""unquantifiable weight,"" and he was again sentenced to death. the supreme court of florida affirmed.

the defendant manufacturers removed the case to federal court, and moved for summary judgment based on the bare metal defense, arguing that they could not be held liable for the sailors’ injuries because they shipped their products out in bare metal form. the district court granted summary judgment as to both the negligence and strict liability claims. the plaintiffs appealed, and the third circuit remanded with instructions to the district court to more clearly address the plaintiffs’ negligence claims, and to explain whether it was applying the bright-line as opposed to the fact-specific rule that can be relevant to the bare metal defense, and regarding which circuits are split. the district court again granted summary judgment on both claims, stating that it was applying the bright line rule. 
the plaintiffs appealed again, but the third circuit did not consider their strict liability claims on appeal because it considered them abandoned. it therefore affirmed the district court’s ruling in favor of summary judgment for the defendants as to strict liability. the third circuit reversed the summary judgment ruling on the negligence claim, holding that maritime law principles permit the manufacturer of a bare metal product to be held liable for asbestos-related injuries when they are reasonably foreseeable results of the manufacturer’s actions. in so holding, the appellate court applied the bare metal defense's fact-specific standard rather than the bright-line rule."

kulbicki filed a petition for post-conviction relief in state court in which he argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed to question the legitimacy of the ballistics evidence. kulbicki’s petition was denied at the trial level, but the maryland court of appeals reversed and vacated kulbicki’s conviction."

246	"the fair labor standards act of 1938 (act) requires every employer to pay each of his employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce a minimum hourly wage and a higher rate for exceeding a maximum number of hours per week. the act excluded the federal government or any state government or political subdivision from the definition of ""employer."" in 1961, the act was amended to include employees of any enterprise engaged in commerce or production of commerce, such as the operation of a hospital or any place that cares for the sick, a school, or an institution of higher education. the act also removed the exemption for the state governments and their political subdivisions.
the state of maryland and twenty-seven other states sued w. willard wirtz, the secretary of labor, to prevent the enforcement of the act as it applied to schools and hospitals operated by states or their subdivisions. the states argued this expansion of the act was unconstitutional because it violated the commerce clause and conflicted with the eleventh amendment's protection of states' sovereign immunity. a three-judge district court held that the extension of the act's coverage to commercial enterprise and state institutions did not exceed congress' powers under the commerce clause because it did not transgress the sovereignty of the states. however, the court declined to consider the eleventh amendment issue. maryland appealed directly to the supreme court."

mary irving, patrick pumpkin seed, and eileen bissonette were enrolled members of the oglala sioux tribe and were heirs or devisees of tribe members who died in 1983. each had inherited a fractional interest in land which they would lose to the tribal government under the indian land consolidation act. 
irving, seed, and bissonette filed suit in the district court claiming that the provision of the indian land consolidation act resulted in taking of property without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment. the district court held that the statute was constitutional and that the complainants had no vested interest in the property of the decedents.the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit reversed the district court. it held that the complainants had standing and that the statute did violate the fifth amendment. the secretary of the interior appealed the appellate court's decision.

the supreme court of hawaii overruled the trial court's decision and remanded the case with instructions to issue an injunction to prevent the transfer of ceded lands from the public trust. in its reasoning, it cited ahuna to illustrate that the state as trustee of these lands was under an obligation to administer the trust 'solely in the interest of the beneficiary' (native hawaiians). further, it gave great weight to the apology resolution passed by the united states congress in 1993 to mark the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii. this resolution stated that ""native hawaiians (1) 'never directly relinquished their claims to... their national lands to the united states,' and (2) 'are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory.'"" therefore, the court held, it was the responsibility of the state of hawaii to preserve the ceded lands in the public trust, at least until such land claims were resolved."

(icon) manufactures and sells exercise equipment throughout the united states. in 2000, icon obtained u.s. patent no. 6,019,710 (the '710 patent) for a system designed to link parts in elliptical exercise machines. in 2010, icon filed a complaint against another manufacturer and seller of exercise equipment, octane fitness (octane), and claimed that octane's elliptical design infringed upon the '710 patent.
the federal district court held that octane's design did not violate icon's '710 patent. icon appealed to the u.s. court of appeal for the federal circuit. octane argued that icon's lawsuit was not based on any real patent infringement, but instead aimed at hampering upstart competitors with expensive, frivolous lawsuits. therefore, octane asked the court to apply a patent law attorney fees statute, a statute that awards attorney fees when the plaintiff's suit is found to be ""exceptional."" the appellate court affirmed the lower court's decision, but found that icon had not acted ""exceptionally"" under the statute."

279	"in september 1997, three hamas suicide bombers blew themselves up in an a crowded area in jerusalem. among the injured were eight u.s. citizens, who consequently filed a lawsuit against the islamic republic of iran for its role in providing material support to the attackers. in general, sovereign governments are immune from lawsuit, but the foreign sovereign immunities act (""fsia"") provides an exception to that immunity in cases of state-sponsored of terrorism. a district judge in d.c. entered a $71.5 million default judgment against iran, which iran did not pay. the plaintiffs then litigated numerous cases across the country in an attempt to attach and execute on iranian assets to satisfy the judgment.
the case at hand involves four collections of ancient persian artifacts within the possession of the university of chicago and chicago's field museum of natural history. with few exceptions, a foreign state's property in the united states is immune from attachment and execution. the plaintiffs argued before the district court that they should be able to attach and execute iran's property under subsections (a) and (g) of 28 u.s.c. § 1610, as well as section 201 of the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 (""tria""). the district court held, and the seventh circuit agreed, that while § 1610(a) permits execution on a foreign state's property ""used for a commercial activity in the united states,"" that provision requires use by the foreign state itself, not a third party (such as a museum). the district court also held, and the seventh circuit agreed, that § 1610(g) permits attachment to property of a foreign state in aid of execution only in cases described elsewhere in § 1610, rendering that provision unavailable to the plaintiffs in this case. finally, the district court held, and the seventh circuit agreed, that § 201 of tria applies only to assets blocked by executive order, and in the absence of an executive order blocking the particular assets sought, plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of that provision either.
the seventh circuit's holding thus conflicts with the ninth circuit's prior holding that § 1610(g) provides a freestanding attachment immunity exception that allows terrorism victims to attach and execute upon any assets of foreign state sponsors of terrorism, regardless of whether the assets are otherwise subject to execution under section 1610."

280	"in april of 2001, the city of indianapolis (""the city"") sent a letter to property owners in the northern estates neighborhood informing them that their properties were part of the brisbane/manning barrett law sanitary sewers project (""the project""). the project was designed to connect properties to the city sewer system, reducing or eliminating the use of septic tanks.
in july of 2004, the indianapolis board of public works (""the board"") levied an assessment of $9,278 against each property subject to the project. indianapolis offered each property owner the option of paying the assessment in its entirety or of paying in monthly installments, subject to an annual interest rate. the petitioners, christine armour and 30 other property owners (""property owners""), chose to pay the assessment in its entirety.
in 2005, the city abandoned the barrett law method of assessing owners' contributions in favor of the septic tank elimination program (""step""). as part of the transition to step, the board passed a measure forgiving all outstanding barrett law assessment balances owed as of november 1, 2005, including those assessed for the project. as a result, owners who chose to pay their assessment in monthly installments were forgiven from future payment. owners who chose to pay their assessments in their entirety were given no reimbursement. the property owners requested compensation from the board in february of 2006 and were denied.
the property owners filed complaint against the city in july of 2007, alleging violation of due process and equal protection under the fourteenth amendment. all parties filed for summary judgment; the trial court granted the property owners' motion, and entered judgment against the city. on appeal, the property owners abandoned their due process claim, arguing that the city violated equal protection. the indiana court of appeals affirmed, holding that the city did not have a rational basis for only forgiving the debt of owners who chose to pay in installments. the indiana supreme court granted the city's motion to transfer the case, vacating the decision of the court of appeals.
justice frank sullivan, writing for a unanimous court, held that the city's tax policy survives rational basis review and does not violate equal protection. the city legitimately believed that 1) owners who fully paid their assessments were in a better financial position than those making monthly installments, 2) the benefits of simplifying funding for the sewer system outweighed the effort of continuing the previous taxation system and 3) the new taxation system would preserve city resources. he rejected the property owners' argument that they were a ""class of one"" --requiring heightened scrutiny of the city's action-- because the property owners were not singled out for discriminatory treatment."

thornton was convicted of drug and firearms offenses. on appeal, he moved to have the gun dismissed as evidence because, he claimed, it had been found as the result of an unconstitutional search. he argued that the officer had contacted him after he had left the vehicle and that the search therefore did not fall within the ""search incident to arrest"" exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement (the exception allows police to search the person being arrested and the area ""within his immediate control"").

notably, the va did not grant kisor relief under section 3.156(c), which authorizes the agency to “reconsider” a previously denied claim in the event that it “receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when va first decided the claim.” this provision is more favorable to veterans because it provides for a retroactive effective date for any benefits awarded, whereas benefits granted under section 3.156(a) are effective only on the date the application to reopen was filed.
the va’s decision (technically made by the board of veterans appeals) relied on the meaning of the term “relevant” as used in 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(c)(1). the va found that the additional documents (kisor’s form 214 and the combat history document) did not qualify as “relevant” for purposes of this section because it did not “suggest or better yet establish that [petitioner] has ptsd as a current disability.” in the va’s view, records are not “relevant” when they are not “outcome determinative.”

when the fmcsa formulated its regulations, it performed an environmental assessment (ea) to examine their effects on the environment. under the national environmental policy act of 1969 (nepa), federal agencies must perform an environmental impact study (eis) of policies that are likely to have significant environmental effects. if an agency feels that its policies will not have significant effects, however, it may perform a more limited environmental assessment (ea) - which is what fmcsa chose to do. public citizen, a watchdog group that monitors government actions, challenged this decision in federal court. it argued that, because fmcsa knew that a large number of mexican trucks would be admitted into the united states once it issued its regulations, it should have considered the environmental impact of the increased number of trucks in addition to the more limited impact of the safety inspections. the impact of the trucks would have been significant enough to warrant an eis, so public citizen argued that fmcsa had violated nepa by not conducting the more stringent study. the district court side with the fmcsa, holding that, while the passage of the regulations was necessary before the trucks could be admitted, the fmcsa nevertheless did not have control of those trucks and therefore did not have to account for them in its environmental assessment; a ninth circuit court of appeals panel reversed."

engle went to the office of donald ambrose, a clerk, and asked for regis lantzy, whom engle believed was responsible for his termination. ambrose said that lantzy was not present, and later testified that engle looked strange, as if something was troubling him. a short time later, engle found lantzy in the plant. engle shot lantzy with a pistol in front of several workers. lantzy tried to flee, and engle shot him several more times. he stood over the body briefly, then returned to ambrose's office and surrendered to a security guard. the guard smelled alcohol on engle's breath, but officers who arrived later on the scene did not detect the odor of alcohol. on december 8th, engle gave a statement to the police. he admitted to purposefully shooting and killing lantzy, albeit under the influence of alcohol.
on trial for murder in july, 1973, engle's sole defense was temporary insanity due to the effects of alcohol, librium, and a dissociative reaction, a temporary mental disorder often accompanied by memory loss. he stated that he remembered nothing between drinking the morning of december 7th and the moment he awoke in jail. he did not remember making a statement to the police.

barton then filed an application for cancellation of removal under 8 u.s.c. § 1229b(a), which allows the attorney general to cancel the removal of an otherwise removable lawful permanent resident if, among other things, the individual “has resided in the united states continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status.” this residency requirement is subject to a “stop-time rule” which terminates the accrual of continuous residency when the individual commits a statutorily described crime that renders the individual “inadmissible” or “removable.” the government argued that barton had not accrued the seven years of continuous residence since his admission to the united states in 1989 because his 1996 crimes triggered the time-stop rule. in response, barton argued that his 1996 crimes did not trigger the stop-time rule because as an already-admitted lawful permanent resident who was not seeking admission or readmission to the united states, he could not as a matter of law be “rendered inadmissible” within the meaning of § 1229b(a).
the immigration judge ruled in the government’s favor, and in a non-precedential single-member decision, the board of immigration appeals affirmed the immigration judge’s decision. on appeal the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed, finding that a person need not seek admission (or readmission) to be “rendered inadmissible.”"	False

the technology never materialized, and w2e sought to avoid complete financial ruin by offering up to $15 million in “debentures”—which is debt secured only by the debtor’s earning power, rather than by a lien on a tangible asset. at the time, w2e’s most recent sec filing did not indicate the possible devaluation of the company’s intangible assets and stated only that they were worth over $10 million.
after an audit, w2e filed a form 8-k reporting total impairment of its intangible assets and valuing its total assets at $370,552. lorenzo’s secretary alerted him via email about the amended filings, and lorenzo contacted the charles vista brokers about them. nearly two weeks later, lorenzo emailed two potential investors “several key points” about w2e’s pending debenture offering, but rather than even mentioning the devaluation of w2e’s intangible assets, he assured both that the offering came with “3 layers of protection,” which were: $10 million in “confirmed assets”; purchase orders and lois for “over $43 [million] in orders”; and charles vista has agreed to raise additional monies to repay the debenture holders if necessary. one of these emails stated it had been sent “at the request of [lorenzo’s boss]” and the other stated it was sent “at the request of [another broker with the firm].” lorenzo’s name and title were at the bottom of both emails.

because an arkansas rule of evidence prohibited the admittance of any evidence obtained through hypnosis, the trial court barred vickie from testifying to her memory of the shooting because it had been “hypnotically refreshed.” she was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. vickie appealed to the supreme court of arkansas, which affirmed her conviction. the supreme court of arkansas held that, in the absence of a general consensus on the accuracy of evidence obtained through hypnosis, case-by-case inquiry into the accuracy of the evidence would be too burdensome on courts. in this case, the exclusion of vickie rock’s hypnotically refreshed memory did not infringe on her constitutional rights because her right to testify in her own defense was only limited by generally applicable rules of evidence intended to exclude confusing or misleading evidence.

lozman kept his floating home in a marina in the city of riviera beach. lozman signed a lease with the city, moored the floating home to the dock, and affixed the home to land based utilities. later, the city council passed a revised dockage agreement and accompanying marina rules. pursuant to these rules, the city informed lozman it would revoke his permission to remain on the marina unless he executed a new agreement and complied with the new regulations. lozman did not execute a new agreement and continued to remain at the marina.
in response, the city filed an in rem suit in federal court for trespass under federal maritime law. the city filed for partial summary judgment on its trespass claim. lozman argued that his floating home was not a ""vessel"" under 1 u.s.c. § 3, and therefore not subject to maritime law. the district court granted the city's motion and held that lozman's floating home was a ""vessel"" for purposes admiralty jurisdiction. the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit agreed with the lower court, and lozman appealed the appellate court's determination that his floating home was a ""vessel"" under 1 u.s.c. § 3."

greene appealed his conviction to the pennsylvania superior court. among other arguments, he renewed his confrontation clause claim. the pennsylvania superior court affirmed, holding that the codefendants' confessions as redacted did not so clearly implicate greene as to violate the confrontation clause and greene then filed a timely petition for allowance of appeal with the pennsylvania supreme court, again pressing his confrontation clause claim. the pennsylvania supreme court granted the petition but eight months later dismissed the appeal ""as having been improvidently granted.""

on august 24, 1951, the union transmitted a letter to the company notifying the company of its desire to modify the agreement. representatives of the company and the union first met on august 29, 1951 to discuss the proposed amendments. the two groups held 37 more meetings between that date and april 30, 1952, but no agreement was reached. on april 30, employees of the company went on strike, demanding wage increases and other benefits. neither the company nor the union notified the other that it intended to terminate the contract. on june 21, 1952, the union offered to return all striking employees to work unconditionally, but the company refused this offer.
the company distributed a letter to the union explaining that there would be no reinstatement of workers unless the employees agreed to work for a period of at least one year without work stoppage. after june 21, the company interviewed individual employees and rehired only those who assured the company that they would continue to work daily throughout the strike. on august 3, 1952, a new agreement was executed between the company and the union; employees were reinstated the next day.

during the negotiations for the new agreement, the union filed a charge of unfair labor practices against the company with the national labor relations board, based on the company’s response to the employees’ offer to return to work. the five member board held in a split decision that the company was guilty of unfair labor practices under the nlra, rejecting the company’s defense that the strikers lost the protection of the act because the contract was still in effect. the company appealed to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit, which set aside the board’s ruling. the eighth circuit held that a strike would violate the terms of the contract until the contract expired or was cancelled in the manner provided for in the nlra. as the contract had not expired when the employees went on strike, those employees violated the terms of the nlra and lost its protection.

also in 1975, the families of philip d. farmar and a. a. sugg, joint owners of 46,515 acres of land in irion county, texas, leased their oil and gas interests to various lessees. under these leases, the farmars and suggs received royalties and annual cash bonuses from the lessees. the bonuses were payable even when the property produced no oil or gas. the farmars and suggs claimed percentage depletion deductions on both the royalties and bonuses, but the commissioner disallowed the deductions on the royalties because they were not based on average daily production from the property. in a consolidated suit, the court of claims held that congress only allowed for depletion deductions from actual production during the taxable year.
 in the tax reduction act of 1975, congress eliminated percentage depletion deductions for major oil producers. § 613a(d), however, authorized any qualified independent gas or oil producer or royalty owner to compute the allowance for percentage depletion in accordance with gross income from the property. the act stipulated that the allowance was tied to the taxpayer’s average daily production so as not to exceed the taxpayer’s depletable quantity. the farmars and suggs and the commissioner filed petitions for writs of certiorari; the supreme court of the united states granted their petitions and consolidated their cases."

424	"in the words of the ninth circuit decision below, “[t]his case arises out of a complex set of bankruptcy proceedings.”
petitioner bradley taggart is a real estate developer who owned 25% interest in sherwood park business center (“spbc”). respondents terry emmert and keith jehnke also each owned a 25% interest in spbc. in 2007, taggart purported to transfer his share of spbc to his attorney, john berman.
emmert and jehnke sued taggart and berman in oregon state court, alleging that the transfer violated spbc’s operating agreement by not allowing emmert and jehnke the right of first refusal. emmert and jehnke also sought attorneys’ fees. taggart moved to dismiss the claim and filed a counterclaim for attorneys’ fees.
in november 2009, shortly before the case went to trial, taggart filed a voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. the state-court action was stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy petition, and in february 2010, taggart received his discharge in the bankruptcy proceedings.
after the discharge, emmert and jehnke, represented by attorney stuart brown, continued the state-court action. taggart was largely absent from subsequent proceedings, although berman renewed his motion to dismiss on taggart’s behalf at the close of evidence. after a trial, the state court ruled in favor of emmert and jehnke and unwound the transfer of taggart’s share of spbc to berman and expelled taggart from the company. the state court entered a judgment that allowed any party to petition for attorneys’ fees, which led to yet more complicated litigation in state and federal courts.
brown, the attorney for emmert and jehnke, filed a petition for attorneys’ fees in state court on behalf of spbc, emmert, and jehnke, against both berman and taggart, but limiting fees against taggart to those incurred after the date of taggart’s bankruptcy discharge. the petition notified the court of taggart’s bankruptcy discharge but argued he could still be liable for attorneys’ fees on the theory that taggart had “returned to the fray.”
while the attorneys’ fee petition was pending in state court, taggart sought to reopen his bankruptcy proceeding in bankruptcy court. once reopened, taggart asked the court to hold brown, jehnke, emmert, and spbc (collectively the “creditors”) in contempt for violating the bankruptcy discharge by seeking an award of attorneys’ fees against him in the state court action.
the state court ruled that taggart had “returned to the fray” as a matter of law, so he could be held liable for attorneys’ fees incurred after his bankruptcy. taggart timely appealed the state-court determination.
subsequently, the bankruptcy court denied taggart’s motion for contempt, agreeing with the state court that taggart had “returned to the fray.” on appeal, the district court reversed, finding that taggart’s actions did not constitute a “return to the fray” and thus the discharge injunction barred the claim against him for attorneys’ fees. the district court remanded for a determination whether the creditors had “knowingly violated the discharge injunction in seeking attorneys’ fees.” on remand, the bankruptcy court found they had knowingly violated the discharge injunction and thus held them in contempt. on appeal, the bankruptcy appellate panel (“bap”) reversed the bankruptcy court’s finding of contempt, finding they had a good faith belief that the discharge injunction did not apply to their attorneys’ fee claim.
back in state court, the state appellate court found that taggart’s actions did not constitute a “return to the fray” and thus reversed the state trial court as to its ruling on attorneys’ fees. as a result, the federal district court and the state appellate court both agreed that the creditors could not pursue attorneys’ fees against taggart, and the bap’s ruling freed them from being held in contempt for knowingly violating the discharge injunction.
the ninth circuit affirmed the bap’s opinion, holding that the creditors did not knowingly violate the discharge injunction and thus could not be held in contempt because they had a subjective good-faith belief that the discharge injunction did not apply to their state-court claim for attorneys’ fees."

438	in 1970, congress enacted the occupational safety and health act (the act), which authorized the secretary of labor to enact mandatory nationwide standards to govern workplace safety. on december 26, 1978, the occupational safety and health administration (osha) published a proposal to change the federal standard regarding cotton dust exposure. there was a 90-day comment period followed by a series of hearings over the course of two weeks. after the hearings, the secretary of labor, raymond j. donovan, determined that exposure to cotton dust represented a significant health risk that warranted the adoption of the new standard. the new standard required a mix of engineering controls, such as the installation of pieces of equipment, along with work practice controls, and required these changes within four years. the petitioners, representing the interests of the cotton industry, challenged the validity of the standard in the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia. they argued that the act required osha to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the costs and benefits associated with the standard. the court of appeals held that osha had done everything required by the act.

439	"jodie nevils was a federal employee with a coventry health care of missouri (coventry) health insurance plan that was governed by the federal employee health benefits act (fehba), which expressly preempts state laws and regulations governing health insurance and benefits plans. after nevils was awarded a settlement in a personal injury case, coventry enforced a claim to the settlement money. nevils sued coventry and argued that missouri law prevented insurance companies from claiming the proceeds of personal injury settlements. the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the insurance company and held that the fehba preempted state law regarding insurance companies’ claims to the proceeds of personal injury settlement. the supreme court of missouri reversed and held that the fehba did not preempt state law in this case because an insurance company’s claim to a personal injury settlement does not clearly relate to “the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits.”
 
after the supreme court of missouri’s decision, the office of personnel management created a new formal rule. that rule stated that an insurance carrier’s rights and responsibilities with respect to the settlement of an individual covered by that insurance carrier’s plan “relate to the nature, provision, and extent of coverage or benefits” for the purpose of the fehba. the u.s. supreme court subsequently granted certiorari for this case and vacated and remanded the lower court’s decision for reconsideration in light of this new rule. on remand, the supreme court of missouri held that there is no precedent that establishes that a federal agency’s interpretation of a preemption clause receives judicial deference. therefore, the supreme court of missouri again determined that the fehba did not preempt missouri state law."

442	"samuel patane was arrested at his home for calling his ex-girlfriend in violation of a restraining order. during the arrest, police officers began reading patane his miranda rights. patane told the officers that he knew his rights. the officers then stopped reading them, at which point patane told police that he had a gun in his house. they searched the house with his permission and found the gun. as an ex-felon, patane was not permitted to possess a gun and was prosecuted for possession.
during the trial on gun possession charges, patane argued that his arrest violated the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures and the fifth amendment right not to incriminate oneself because there was not probable cause to arrest him and because the gun had been found as a result of an un-mirandized confession.
the district court initially ruled that there was not probable cause for his arrest and that it was therefore unconstitutional. a 10th circuit court of appeals panel disagreed, holding that patane's ex-girlfriend had given police probable cause for the arrest. however, the panel held that gun could not be used as evidence because it had been found as the result of an un-mirandized (and therefore unconstitutional) confession. the government appealed, arguing that physical evidence found as the result of un-mirandized testimony could be used in court, despite the fact that the testimony itself was inadmissible."

446	"the plaintiff/respondents in this case are former enslaved children who were kidnapped and forced to work on cocoa farms in the ivory coast for up to fourteen hours without pay. they filed a class-action lawsuit against large manufacturers, purchasers, processors, and retail sellers of cocoa beans, including petitioner nestle usa (and cargill inc., petitioner in a consolidated case).
nestle usa, inc., and cargill, inc., both domestic corporations, effectively control cocoa production in the ivory coast and operate “with the unilateral goal of finding the cheapest source of cocoa in the ivory coast,” resulting in a “system built on child slavery to depress labor costs.” the respondents allege that the defendants are aware that child slave labor is a problem in the ivory coast yet continue to provide financial support and technical farming aid to farmers who use forced child labor.
the children filed a proposed class action in the u.s. district court for the central district of california, alleging that the defendant companies were liable under the alien tort statute (ats) for aiding and abetting child slavery in the ivory coast. the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss based on its conclusion that corporations cannot be sued under the ats, and that even if they could, the plaintiffs failed to allege the elements of a claim for aiding and abetting slave labor. the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed, holding that corporations are liable for aiding and abetting slavery, in part because it found that norms that are “universal and absolute” can provide the basis for an ats claim against a corporation, and the prohibition of slavery is “universal.” it did not address the defendants’ argument that the complaint sought an extraterritorial application of the ats, which the u.s. supreme court had recently proscribed in kiobel v. royal dutch petroleum co., 569 u.s. 108 (2013). on remand, the district court dismissed the claims alleging aiding and abetting slave labor under the ats, finding that the complaint sought an impermissible extraterritorial application of the ats.
in the interim, the u.s. supreme court decided jesner v. arab bank, plc, 584 u.s. __ (2018), holding that foreign corporations cannot be sued under the ats. again the ninth circuit reversed, finding that the holding in jesner does not disturb its prior holding as to the domestic defendants, nestle usa, inc., and cargill, inc., and that the specific domestic conduct alleged by the plaintiffs falls within the focus of the ats and does not require extraterritorial application of that statute."

447	"vincent foster, a high-ranking white house lawyer involved in the investigation of possible fraud by the clinton family in the whitewater real estate venture, was found dead in a virginia park. two government investigations subsequently found that the death had been a suicide. allan favish questioned the findings of the government investigations, claiming that they were part of a government cover-up of murder. under the freedom of information act, favish requested access to 150 photos of foster's body in the park and during the autopsy. he later reduced his request to 129 photos.
the government initially denied him access to all the photos, but eventually gave him access to 118 of them. it withheld the rest, arguing that the privacy interest of foster's family members in relation to foster's death trumped the public interest served by providing favish access to the photos. the government stated that the photos were very graphic and that releasing them would upset the family. favish countered by arguing that the family did not have a relevant privacy interest; the only person whose privacy interests would be violated by the release of the photos was foster, favish argued, and foster's death had rendered him incapable of exercising that interest.
after a series of appeals in which a ninth circuit panel held that the foster family's right to privacy was relevant to the case but that the district court must look at the specific photos in order to weigh the privacy rights against favish's right to access government information, the ninth circuit eventually decided that favish should be given access to all but four of the photos. the government, joined by the foster family, appealed the decision to the supreme court."

454	"a u.s. drug enforcement agency (dea) special agent was kidnapped and murdered by a mexican drug cartel in 1985. after an investigation, the dea concluded that humberto alvarez-machain had participated in the murder. a warrant for his arrest was issued by a federal district court. the dea, however, was unable to convince mexico to extradite alvarez-machain, so they hired several mexican nationals to capture him and bring him back to the united states. his subsequent trial went all the way to the supreme court, which found that the government could try a person who had been forcibly abducted, but that the abduction itself might violate international and provide grounds for a civil suit. when the case went back to the district court for trial, alvarez-machain was found not guilty for lack of evidence.
alvarez-machain then filed a group of civil suits in federal court against the united states and the mexican nationals who had captured him under the federal tort claims act (ftca), which allows the federal government to be sued on tort claims, and the alien tort statute (ats), which permits suits against foreign citizens in american courts. the government argued that the ftca applied only to claims arising from actions that took place in the united states and therefore did not cover alvarez-machain's case because the arrest took place in mexico. further, the government and the mexican nationals argued that the ats gave federal courts jurisdiction to hear tort claims against foreign citizens, but did not allow private individuals to bring those suits.
the federal district court disagreed with the government's contention that the fcta claim did not apply, finding that plan to capture alvarez-machain was developed on u.s. soil and therefore covered. however, the court then ruled that the dea had acted lawfully when they arrested alvarez-machain and was therefore not liable. on the ats claims, the court rejected the argument that private individuals could not bring suit under the act. the court found that jose francisco sosa, one of the mexican nationals who kidnapped alvarez- machain, had violated international law and was therefore liable under the ats.
on appeal, the ninth circuit court of appeals overturned the district court's ftca decision, ruling that the dea could not authorize a citizen's arrest of alvarez-machain in another country and was therefore liable. the appeals court did, however, affirm the lower court's finding on the ats claim, upholding the judgment against sosa."

on appeal, the louisiana supreme court upheld the trial court, ruling that the trial judge had not acted unreasonably when he accepted the prosecution's race-neutral justifications for the dismissals of the black jurors. the court ruled that the o.j. simpson references were harmless comparisons made in the course of a rebuttal, and it noted that the prosecution had not mentioned simpson's or snyder's race. when the supreme court instructed the state court to reconsider the case in light of miller-el v. dretke, which requires that courts consider the totality of the circumstances when evaluating discriminatory intent, the court affirmed the trial court a second time."

on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit reversed, holding that the nrab denied the plaintiffs due process by requiring evidence of conferencing on the record as a prerequisite to arbitration. the court reasoned that this requirement was not clearly established in the statutes, regulations, or collective bargaining agreement and therefore the nrab had created a new requirement, which it imposed retroactively."

477	"petitioner pdr network is a company that “delivers health knowledge products and services” to healthcare providers and is perhaps most known for publishing the physicians’ desk reference, a popular reference book with information on various prescription drugs. in december 2013, pdr network sent by fax to carlton &amp; harris, a chiropractic office in west virginia, an advertisement for a free ebook version of the 2014 physicians’ desk reference. the material advised that the recipient had received the offer “because you are a member of the pdr network.”
on behalf of itself and a class of similarly situated recipients of faxes from pdr network, carlton &amp; harris sued pdr network in federal court under the telephone consumer protection act (“tcpa”), as amended by the junk fax prevention act of 2005, which generally prohibits the use of a fax machine to send “unsolicited advertisement[s].” under that statute, the recipient of an unsolicited fax advertisement can sue the sender for damages and recover actual monetary loss or $500 in statutory damages for each violation. if a court finds the sender “willfully or knowingly violated” the tcpa, the recipient is entitled to triple damages.
as a preliminary matter, the court found that the hobbs act does not require the court to defer to the fcc’s interpretation of an unambiguous term. substituting its own definition of “unsolicited advertisement” for the fcc’s definition of the term, which was promulgated by rule in 2006 (“2006 fcc rule”), the court found that pdr network’s fax was not an unsolicited advertisement because it lacked a “commercial aim.” moreover, the court found that even under the 2006 fcc rule, the fax would not be an “unsolicited advertisement.” for this reason, the district court granted pdr network’s motion to dismiss.
carlton &amp; harris appealed, and the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit vacated the lower court’s decision, finding that the hobbs act disallows district courts from considering the validity of orders like the 2006 fcc rule, and that the district court’s interpretation of the rule is at odds with the plain meaning of its text."

478	while serving a life sentence for murder in georgia, robert jones escaped and committed a second murder in 1982. jones was sentenced to a second life term. at the time of jones' second offense, georgia law required the state's board of pardons and paroles (board) to consider inmates serving life sentences for parole after seven years and if it was not granted at that time, that it be reconsidered every three years thereafter. jones was initially considered for parole in 1989, seven years after his 1982 conviction, and parole was denied. after jones was incarcerated but before his first parole hearing, the board amended its rule to require that parole reconsideration take place only once every eight years. subsequently, the board scheduled jones for reconsideration eight years later, in 1997. however, a federal court of appeals ruling, that such board actions could not be applied retroactively, allowed jones to be reconsidered for parole in 1992 and again in 1995. then a u.s. supreme court decision was read to allow for retroactive adjustments in parole and jones was scheduled for reconsideration in 2003 (eight years later), rather then in 1998. jones sued the board members, claiming that retroactive application of the amended rule violated the ex post facto clause. the district court ruled in favor of the board. in reversing, the court of appeals found that the amended rule's retroactive application was necessarily an ex post facto violation.

the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit held that it was pereida’s burden to establish his eligibility for cancellation of removal. however, the court determined that it was not possible to ascertain which statutory subsection formed the basis for pereida's conviction, so pereida failed to meet his burden. because pereida did not establish that he was eligible for cancellation of removal, the court upheld the board of immigration appeals’ determination that he did not show such eligibility and denied pereida’s petition for review."

on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed, holding that prisoners may not raise challenges to an original sentence that could have been raised in an earlier petition. the court also held that mr. magwood's counsel was not ineffective because he failed to raise an argument that had already been decided by the state's highest court adverse to his client's position."

the defenders of wildlife challenged the transfer, arguing that the esa imposed an authoritative, independent requirement on the epa's decision to approve the transfer. the agency countered the esa was not an independent source of authority. rather, the esa imposes requirements only on the discretionary decisions of federal agencies. since its decision was non-discretionary under the cwa, the agency argued, the esa did not apply. the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit agreed with defenders of wildlife and invalidated the transfer. the ninth circuit found the fws opinion legally flawed and the epa's reliance on it ""arbitrary and capricious."" it noted that the epa's decision was inconsistent with previous transfers of permitting authority, in which the impact on endangered species was considered."

in support of his objection, perkins produced three previously unpresented affidavits that alluded to his innocence. the affidavits were signed in 1997, 1999 and 2002, so the district court denied the writ, holding that the adepa statute of limitations extension expired in 2003, one year after the last affidavit was signed. perkins then asked the court to extend the statute of limitations because he was actually innocent of the crime. the district court rejected this argument, holding that the ""new"" evidence was not the type needed to pursue an actual innocence claim, and even if it were, perkins did not pursue his claims with reasonable diligence. the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed, holding that although the u.s. supreme court has held that tolling the statute of limitations requires parties to be reasonably diligent in pursuit of their claims, no court has analyzed whether actual innocence claims must be pursued in the same way."

an immigration judge ruled that moncrieffe was removable, holding that the petitioner's conviction was an aggravated felony because moncrieffe was convicted under a state law which was similar to a federal law which made possession of marijuana with intent to distribute a felony. moncrieffe appealed and argued that possession of such a small amount of marijuana would not be a felony under federal law, but rather a misdemeanor. the board of immigration appeals rejected moncrieffe's argument and dismissed the appeal. the united state court of appeals for the fifth circuit upheld the deportation order."

oklahoma-based company helmerich &amp; payne international drilling company owns a subsidiary that contracts with the venezuelan state-owned corporation that controls the exploration, production, and exportation of oil in venezuela. in 2007, the two companies executed contracts for the venezuelan corporation to use helmerich &amp; payne’s drilling rigs. by 2008, the unpaid debt from those contracts totaled more than $63 million, and when the debt was over $100 million in 2009, helmerich &amp; payne announced it would not be renewing the contract and packed up its drills. employees of the venezuelan corporation, assisted by members of the venezuelan national guard blockaded the yards in which helmerich &amp; payne was keeping its equipment, and then-president hugo chavez issued a decree of expropriation. helmerich &amp; payne sued venezuela and its state-owned corporation in federal district court under the expropriation and commercial activity exceptions to the fsia. venezuela moved to dismiss, and the district court granted the motion with respect to the expropriation claim but denied it with respect to the commercial activity claim. the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed and held that, because the expropriation claim was neither insubstantial nor frivolous, the district court should not have granted the motion to dismiss that claim."

510	a new collective bargaining agreement increased health benefits for widows of coal miners who were receiving pensions when they died.  the agreement did not increase benefits for widows of coal miners who were still working at the time they died, although they were eligible for pensions.  these health benefits were paid out of a trust fund financed by the operators.  gracie robinson and juanita hager brought this class action on behalf of all similarly situated widows.  they alleged that requiring the worker to be receiving a pension at the time of death to qualify for increased health benefits bore no relation to the purpose of the trust.  the district court denied relief, but the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed.  the court of appeals held that the collective bargaining agreement failed to meet the reasonable standard set out in the labor management relations act (lmra).  the lmra requires pension trusts to be maintained “for the sole and exclusive benefit of employees...and their families”.

the u.s. district court for the southern district of california denied nifla’s motion for preliminary injunction, concluding that they had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, as required under winter v. natural resources defense council, inc., 555 u.s. 7 (2008), as to either their free speech or free exercise claims.
the ninth circuit affirmed, ruling that the district court had not abused its discretion by denying the injunction. the court rejected nifla’s argument that strict scrutiny should apply to the act, because while the law compelled content-based speech by requiring nifla to disseminate information about low-cost family planning services, it did not discriminate based on viewpoint. relying on its own precedent in the face of a circuit split regarding the level of scrutiny to apply in the abortion-related disclosure context, the court reasoned that the type of speech at issue in this case was professional speech. it was therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny, which the family planning information disclosure requirement survived. 
the court also affirmed that the requirement that unlicensed facilities disclose their unlicensed status survived any level of scrutiny.
finally, the court agreed with the decision below that nifla was not entitled to a preliminary injunction on free exercise grounds, finding that the act to be a facially neutral law of general applicability that survived rational basis review. the supreme court’s grant of certiorari did not include this issue."

543	the attorney general of massachusetts promulgated comprehensive regulations governing the advertising and sale of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars. members of the tobacco industry filed suit challenging the regulations. lorillard tobacco company and others asserted that under the supremacy clause the cigarette advertising regulations were preempted by the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act (fclaa), which prescribes mandatory health warnings for cigarette packaging and advertising and that the regulations violated the first and fourteenth amendments. ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed the district court's rulings that the cigarette advertising regulations are not pre-empted by the fclaa and that neither the regulations prohibiting outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground nor the sales practices regulations restricting the location and distribution of tobacco products violated the first amendment. reversing the lower court's finding, the appellate court found that the point-of-sale advertising regulations requiring that indoor advertising be placed no lower than five feet from the floor were valid.

krull moved to suppress evidence found during the search because the law that police officers relied on was now unconstitutional.  as a general rule, any evidence obtained during an unlawful search is excluded at trial.  illinois argued that because the police officer acted in good faith, the evidence was admissible.  the trial court granted krull’s motion.  the state appellate court vacated the judgment and remanded.  on remand, the trial court maintained its original position and granted the motion to suppress.  the supreme court of illinois affirmed."

the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed the lower court. the eleventh circuit ruled that in the absence of a clear statement in the 4-r act, principles of federalism weighed against interpreting the act to give railroads additional power to challenge the taxing authority of the states in federal court. the circuit court stood by the general principle that federal courts should not interfere with state taxation policies. since the 4-r act did not allow challenges to the state's choice of valuation method, csx could not bring its arguments that georgia's methodology was faulty."

before the sentencing hearing occurred, the prosecution determined that a second of cuero’s prior convictions qualified as a “strike” and that the guilty-plea form erroneously listed only one strike. the fact that the present conviction would constitute his third “strike” under the law, cuero faced instead a minimum sentence of 25 years. the state asked the trial court for permission to amend the criminal complaint accordingly, and over cuero’s objection, the court granted the state’s motion. however, the court permitted cuero to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the change. cuero withdrew his initial guilty plea and entered a new guilty plea to the amended complaint, which charged cuero with one felony.
the trial court sentenced cuero to 25 years to life, his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the california supreme court denied a state habeas petition.

tennessee asked that the case be dismissed, claiming that it was barred by the 11th amendment's prohibition of suits against states in federal courts (the sovereign immunity doctrine). the state cited alabama v. garrett (2001), in which the u.s. supreme court ruled that congress had acted unconstitutionally in granting citizens the right to sue states for disability discrimination (such as the denial of employment) under the 14th amendment's equal protection clause. in that case the supreme court reasoned that congress did not have enough evidence of disability discrimination by states to justify the waiver of sovereign immunity.
the district court rejected the state's argument and denied the motion to dismiss. the sixth circuit court of appeals panel affirmed. the courts reasoned that because title ii of the ada dealt with the due process clause of the 14th amendment, not the equal protection clause, the ruling in garrett did not apply. the court found that while congress may not have had enough evidence of disability discrimination to waive sovereign immunity for equal protection claims, it did have enough evidence of due process violations (such as non-handicap-accessible courthouses) to waive the sovereign immunity doctrine for due process claims."

prior to trial, a judge ruled the three-year-old child was incompetent to testify but refused to exclude the child's out-of-court identification of clark as his abuser. clark was found guilty. on appeal clark claimed that the admission of the child's out-of-court statements violated his sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. the supreme court of ohio reversed the lower court's ruling and held that, because state law required the teacher to report suspected incidences of child abuse, the teacher was acting as an agent for law enforcement when inquiring about the child's injuries. therefore, the child's out-of-court statements could only be admitted if the primary purpose of the teacher's questioning was to address an ongoing emergency, as opposed to attempting to establish past events. because the child was not in immediate danger of further injury, the out-of-court statement could not be admitted."

576	"a california state court convicted scott lynn pinholster of double murder and sentenced him to death. after exhausting his state court remedies, he petitioned for habeas corpus relief in a california federal district court, arguing that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial. the district court upheld pinholster's conviction but granted habeas relief on his death sentence. a panel of the ninth circuit reversed.
during rehearing en banc, the ninth circuit vacated the panel opinion and affirmed the district court’s grant of habeas relief, holding that the denial of habeas relief during the guilt phase was appropriate, but not during the penalty phase. the court noted that strickland v. washington requires trial counsel to investigate mitigating evidence at the penalty phase. here, the court reasoned that pinholster's counsel failed meet to meet his obligations."

583	police caught charles borden, jr., with a pistol during a traffic stop in april 2017, and he subsequently pleaded guilty possessing that firearm as a felon, in violation of 18 u.s.c. § 922(g)(1). at sentencing, the government recommended sentencing borden as an armed career criminal, under the armed career criminal act (acca), based on three prior tennessee aggravated assault convictions. borden objected, arguing that one of his prior convictions—reckless aggravated assault—did not qualify as a “violent felony” under the “use of force” clause of the acca. borden argued that reckless aggravated assault requires only a mental state of recklessness, and reckless use of force does not amount to a crime of violence under the acca. retroactively applying sixth circuit precedent holding that reckless aggravated assault does constitute a violent felony under the “use of force” clause of the acca, the district court held that all three of borden’s aggravated assault victims constituted “crime[s] of violence” under the acca and designated him as an armed career criminal. the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed.

a three-judge district court agreed with wrtl's arguments and ruled the bcra unconstitutional as applied to the ads. the court refused the fec's request that it inquire into the intent and likely effect of the ads, because those determinations would be impractical and would have a chilling effect on protected speech. analyzing only the explicit content of the ads, the court found them to be legitimate issue ads and not express advocacy or sham issue ads. the court also held that the government's justification for banning express advocacy ads by corporations - the need to reduce political corruption and public cynicism - did not apply to ads that do not endorse or oppose a candidate. therefore, the court ruled that the government lacked a compelling interest to justify the burden on wrtl's first amendment rights."

the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed the conviction, but vacated mr. skilling's sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. the court first held that the government's theory under the ""honest services"" fraud statute was valid. it reasoned that it was immaterial whether enron's board of directors knew or even tacitly approved of mr. skilling's fraudulent conduct when he withheld information that would lead a reasonable employer to change its conduct. moreover, the court held that while mr. skilling proved that there was sufficient inflammatory and pervasive pretrial publicity to require a presumption that prejudice tainted the jury, the government met its burden to show that jury screening was adequate, and that the district court did not empanel any juror who was unconstitutionally prejudiced."

exxon and other oil and gas producers sued ralph eagerton, the commissioner of revenue in alabama and argued that the national gas policy act, which allowed natural gas producers to take steps to recoup state severance tax, preempted the prohibitions on passing along the costs to purchasers. furthermore, the oil and gas producers argued that the exemption and the prohibition violated the oil and gas producers’ constitutional rights under the contract clause and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. the circuit court of montgomery county ruled the new severance tax provisions unconstitutionally violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment and the contract clause. the state appealed to the supreme court of alabama, which reversed the lower court’s decision, holding any constraints imposed by the new tax were generally applicable and therefore valid.

625	"the so-called dormant commerce clause of the us constitution prohibits states from imposing excessive burdens on interstate commerce without congressional approval. consistent with this doctrine, the us supreme court held, in 1967, that a state cannot require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence within that state to collect and remit taxes for goods sold or shipped into the state. the court affirmed this holding in 1992. in 2015, the court heard another case with similar facts and while it declined to change its jurisprudence, justice kennedy wrote a separate concurrence questioning whether the court should continue following the earlier cases in light of additional dormant commerce clause cases as well as the significant technological and social changes that affect interstate commerce.
in an apparent appeal to the doubt expressed by justice kennedy in that concurring opinion, the south dakota legislature passed a law requiring sellers of “tangible personal property” in that state who do not have a physical presence in the state to remit sales tax according to the same procedures as sellers who do have a physical presence. the act limited the obligation to sellers with gross revenue from sales in south dakota of over $100,000, or 200 or more separate transactions, within one year. the legislature passed the law in defiance of supreme court jurisprudence, citing its inability to maintain state revenue in the face of increasing internet sales and their effect on sales tax collections.

the court of appeals of arizona agreed with johnson and reversed his conviction and sentence. the court found that the officers had no reason to believe that johnson was involved in any criminal activity when he was searched. the officers requested that johnson step out of the car to discuss gang activity, not because the officers feared that their safety was threatened, thus it was part of a consensual encounter between the officers and johnson. therefore, the court said, the officers' subsequent search of johnson was illegal and unconstitutional."

emily's parents and guardian brought suit against the dhhs, claiming that federal medicaid law prevents the dhhs from taking her proceeds. federal law prohibits recovery from any payments not made for past medical expenses. since under north carolina law a minor child is not allowed to recover for past medical expenses, emily's settlement could not include such expenses. the united states district court for the western district of north carolina disagreed with this argument and granted summary judgment to the state.
the armstrongs appealed, and the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit vacated the lower court's decision. while the appellate court agreed with the lower court that the dhhs has the right to recover from emily's settlement, it remanded the case because the state failed to provide a mechanism for determining what part of a settlement covers past medical expenses. since the north carolina statutes do not attempt to recover payment for past medical expenses, they violate federal medicaid law."

young sued ups and claimed she had been the victim of gender-and disability-based discrimination under the americans with disabilities act and the pregnancy discrimination act. ups moved for summary judgment and argued that young could not show that ups's decision was based on her pregnancy or that she was treated differently than a similarly situated co-worker. furthermore, ups argued it had no obligation to offer young accommodations under the americans with disabilities act because young's pregnancy did not constitute a disability. the district court dismissed young's claim. the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed."

the california supreme court found no constitutional violation and remanded the case to a california court of appeals, which also did not find the burden disproportionate. barcal and bbi also contended that the ""worldwide combined reporting"" method risked double taxation by the state and the federal government. additionally, the ""worldwide combined reporting"" method deviated from taxing methods employed by other states, thus transgressing the federal government's interest in providing uniform standards for taxing foreign commerce.

682	"in february 1958, master sergeant james stanley volunteered to participate in a military program ostensibly testing the effectiveness of protective clothing and equipment against chemical warfare. he spent a month at the army’s chemical warfare laboratories and during that time was secretly administered doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (lsd). as a result of his exposure to lsd, stanley began experiencing hallucinations, memory loss, impaired performance of his job, and he engaged in domestic violence without remembering it later. he was discharged from the army in 1969. in 1975, stanley received a letter from the military asking for his cooperation in a study to determine the long-term effects of lsd and referring to his previous “voluntary” involvement in the 1958 tests. this letter was the first notification that stanley received regarding the true purpose of the 1958 tests. he sued the government under the federal torts claim act (ftca) and argued that there had been negligence in the administration, supervision, and subsequent monitoring of the drug testing program.
the district court granted the government’s motion for summary judgment and held that the government was not liable for negligence that occurred while stanley was on active duty. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed but also held that the district court should have dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. on remand, stanley amended his complaint to include claims that unknown officers violated his constitutional rights and argued that the constitutional claim did not fall under the service exception to the ftca. the district court again dismissed the claim under the ftca and rejected the government’s argument that the same exception barred stanley’s constitutional claims. the government moved for partial final judgment because stanley had not named individual defendants. stanley filed a second amended complaint that named individual defendants, but before the court ruled on it, the supreme court decided chappell v. wallace, which held that enlisted military personnel may not file constitutional claims. the district court held that the chappell decision did not bar stanley’s constitutional claims. the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed and held that recent precedent did not require stanley’s ftca claim to be barred."

685	"the borden company and bowman dairy company were both large distributors of milk products based in chicago, illinois. each company sold dairy products to retail stores under a plan that gave independent stores discounts on the list prices based on the volume of the independent stores' purchases, up to a specified maximum discount. the dairies granted grocery chain stores a flat discount, without reference to the volume of their purchases, at a rate substantially higher than the maximum discount available to independent grocery stores.
the government brought a section 2(a) clayton act suit against the borden company and bowman dairy company, seeking an injunction against selling milk products at prices which discriminated between the independent groceries and the chain groceries. each company conducted its own cost study in an attempt to demonstrate that the differences in pricing between independent groceries and chain groceries were due to actual cost differences. the cost studies demonstrated that it was less costly on average to sell to chain stores. so, the dairy companies argued that the price discrimination was justified by the cost justification proviso of the clayton act.

the three presidential electors sued the colorado department of state, alleging that the law requiring presidential electors to vote for the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote in that state violates their constitutional rights under article ii and the twelfth amendment of the federal constitution. the district court dismissed the action, finding the electors lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, and in the alternative, because the electors failed to state a legal claim because the constitution does not prohibit states from requiring electors to vote for the winner of the state’s popular vote. the u.s. court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed the district court as to mr. baca’s standing, but reversed as to the standing of the other two electors who did not cast their votes in violation of the law. on the merits, the tenth circuit reversed the lower court, finding the state’s removal of mr. baca and nullification of his vote were unconstitutional."

688	"the clean water act (cwa) requires national pollutant discharge elimination system (npdes) permits for the discharge of pollutants to navigable waters from point sources, which the cwa defines as “discernible, confined, and discrete conveyances.” in contrast, all other sources of pollution are characterized as nonpoint sources and are controlled through the environmental protection agency (epa) and other non-cwa programs. the cwa also distinguishes between groundwater and navigable waters, the latter being “waters of the united states” and exclusive of the former.
constructed with funding by the epa in the 1970s, the county of maui’s lahaina wastewater reclamation facility treats wastewater generated by homes and business in the western part of maui by injecting treated wastewater (called “effluent”) into underground injection control (uic) wells—a common method used by municipalities to dispose of effluent. before injection, effluent is treated to meet r-1 water standards, hawaii’s highest standards for recycled water. some of the treated effluent is used for resort and golf course irrigation. upon injection, effluent immediately mixes with groundwater and disperses vertically and horizontally, eventually migrating to the ocean. over 90% of the effluent/groundwater mixture enters the ocean through diffuse flow, with no identifiable entry point. reports from 1973, 1991, and 1994 indicate that both the epa and the hawaii department of health (hdoh) understood that the wastewater entered the ocean, and neither agency suggested that this result required npdes permitting.
the district court at summary judgment held that the county violated the cwa by discharging effluent through groundwater and into the ocean without the npdes permit required by the cwa, and that the county had fair notice of its violations. the court based its ruling on findings that the county “indirectly discharged[d] a pollutant into the ocean through a groundwater conduit,” (2) the groundwater is a “point source” as defined by the cwa, and (3) the groundwater is a “navigable water” under the cwa. the county appealed, and a panel of the ninth circuit affirmed the lower court."

690	"in the credit-card industry, there is what is called a “two-sided market.” cardholders benefit from holding a card only if that card is accepted by a wide range of merchants, and merchants benefit from accepting a card only if a sufficient number of cardholders use it. thus, the cardholder and the merchant both depend on widespread acceptance of a card.
in the united states, credit-card transaction volume is comprised primarily of four networks: visa (45%), american express (26.4%), mastercard (23.3%), and discover (5.3%). because of the way visa and mastercard transactions are handled, they do not directly set certain fees, but merely influence these prices. in contrast, american express is directly involved in the vast majority of transactions involving its cards. thus, it maintains direct relationships with both its cardholders and merchants and directly sets the relevant fees.
in the 1980s, visa and mastercard adopted exclusionary rules preventing member institutions from issuing card products on the amex or discover networks, and ran ad campaigns highlighting amex’s smaller network and higher merchant fees. in response, amex strengthened contractual restraints designed to control how merchants treat amex cardholders at the point of sale, known as non-discriminatory provisions (ndps).
in 2010, the federal government and 17 states sued amex, visa, and mastercard for unreasonably restraining trade in violation of the sherman act. they alleged that the credit card companies used anti-steering provisions to suppress competition and block competition from rival networks. in 2011, visa and mastercard entered into consent judgments and voluntarily rescinded their anti-steering provisions. amex proceeded to trial, and the district court ruled that amex’s ndps violated us antitrust laws. reviewing the district court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo, the second circuit reversed the district court, holding that the lower court should have weighed the ndps’ net effect on both merchants and cardholders under the generally accepted “rule of reason.”"	False

in burwell v. hobby lobby stores, inc., 573 u.s. 682 (2014), the supreme court held that under the religious freedom restoration act (rfra), closely-held for-profit corporations were also entitled to invoke the exemption if they had sincere religious objections to the provision of contraceptive coverage. then, in wheaton college v. burwell, 573 u.s. 958, (2014), the court held that an entity seeking an exemption did not need to file the accommodation form; rather, its notification to the department of health and human services (hhs) was sufficient to receive the exemption. hhs and the departments of labor and treasury promulgated a final rule in compliance with these rulings.
then, in zubik v. burwell, 578 u.s. __ (2017), the court considered another challenge to the rule, which asserted that merely submitting the accommodation notice “substantially burden[ed] the exercise of their religion,” in violation of rfra. in a per curiam opinion, the court declined to reach the merits of that question.

717	"the united states captured the island of guam from spain in 1898, during the spanish-american war. from 1903, the united states maintained military rule until the passage of the guam organic act in 1950, which formally transferred power from the united states to guam’s newly formed civilian government. guam remains an “unincorporated territory of the united states.”
in the 1940s, the navy constructed and operated the ordot dump for the disposal of municipal and military waste, allegedly including munitions and chemicals such as ddt and agent orange, and continued to use the landfill throughout the korean and vietnam wars. the ordot dump lacked basic environmental safeguards, and as a result, contaminants were released into the lonfit river, which ultimately flows into the pacific ocean.
in 1983, the environmental protection agency (epa) added the ordot dump to its national priorities list, and in 1988, it designated the navy as a potentially responsible party. however, because the navy had relinquished sovereignty over the island, guam remained the owner and operator of the ordot dump. as such, the epa repeatedly ordered guam to propose plans for containing and disposing of waste at the landfill.
in 2002, the epa sued guam under the clean water act, asking the court to require guam to comply with the act, in part by submitting plans and a compliance schedule for a cover system of the ordot dump, and by completing construction of the cover system. the epa and guam agreed that guam would pay a civil penalty, close the ordot dump, and design a cover system. guam closed the ordot dump in 2011.
in 2017, guam sued the united states, alleging that the navy was responsible for the ordot dump’s contamination and was thus responsible for the costs of closing and remediating the landfill. guam’s claims rested on two provisions of the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla). section 107 allows for a “cost-recovery” action and section 113(f) allows for a “contribution” action. the statute of limitations for the former action is six years, compared to only three for the latter. the district court concluded that guam’s agreement with the epa did not trigger section 113, so guam could maintain its section 107 claim against the united states. the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia reversed."

the government brought the case to federal district court, but the court decided that it lacked the authority to settle the factual dispute at the root of the attorney general's certification. instead, the court assumed that osborn's account was true, ruled that haley had been outside the scope of his employment by influencing haley's firing, and sent the case back to state court.
the government appealed to the court of appeals for the sixth circuit, which reversed the lower court. the circuit court ruled that the westfall act gives the courts power to settle factual disputes over the incident at issue in a lawsuit, even if the dispute is over whether or not the incident happened at all. the sixth circuit also ruled that the district court should not have sent the case back to state court, because the westfall act gives the federal courts jurisdiction over the case even after the federal district court finds that the attorney general was wrong to certify the federal employee.

749	"on november 12, 1984, dethorne graham, a diabetic, had an insulin reaction while doing auto work at his home. he asked a friend, william berry, to drive him to a convenience store in order to purchase some orange juice to counter his reaction. when they arrived at the store, graham rapidly left the car. he entered the store and saw a line of four or five persons at the counter; not wanting to wait in line, he quickly left the store and returned to berry’s car. officer m.s. connor, a charlotte police officer, observed graham entering and exiting the store unusually quickly. he followed the car and pulled it over about a half mile away.
graham, still suffering from an insulin reaction, exited the car and ran around it twice. berry and officer connor stopped graham, and he sat down on the curb. he soon passed out; when he revived he was handcuffed and lying face down on the sidewalk. several more police officers were present by this time. the officers picked up graham, still handcuffed, and placed him over the hood of berry’s car. graham attempted to reach for his wallet to show his diabetic identification, and an officer shoved his head down into the hood and told him to shut up. the police then struggled to place graham in the squad car over graham’s vigorous resistance. officer connor soon determined, however, that graham had not committed a crime at the convenience store, and returned him to his home. graham sustained multiple injuries, including a broken foot, as a result of the incident.
graham filed § 1983 charges against connor, other officers, and the city of charlotte, alleging a violation of his rights by the excessive use of force by the police officers, unlawful assault, unlawful restraint constituting false imprisonment, and that the city of charlotte improperly trained its officers in violation of the rehabilitation act of 1973. the city of charlotte filed for a directed verdict, which the district court granted. graham appealed the ruling on the use of excessive force, contending that the district court incorrectly applied a four-part substantive due process test from johnson v. glick that takes into account officers’ “good faith” efforts and whether they acted “maliciously or sadistically”. he instead argued for a standard of “objective reasonableness” under the fourth amendment. the united states court of appeals, fourth circuit, rejected this argument, reasoning that concepts such as ""good faith"" are relevant to determining the degree of force used. it affirmed the directed verdict, holding that a reasonable jury could not have found in graham’s favor."

the u.s. court of appeals affirmed the ruling for a different reason, citing the u.s. supreme court decision heck v. humphrey (1994). in heck the court held that when a prisoner seeks damages in a case that questions his sentence, the prisoner must first have successfully challenged the sentence itself or the conviction itself. the court of appeals held that because muhammad's damages case questioned his sentence, he must first successfully appeal the sentence itself. going further the court of appeals held that heck applies to all challenges to prison disciplinary proceedings."

elgin initially challenged his termination before the merit systems protection board, which has jurisdiction over challenged terminations of federal employees under certain conditions under the civil service reform act. on november 16, 2007, the merit systems protection board dismissed elgin's appeal because it lacked jurisdiction over appeals where employees were terminated under absolute statutory prohibitions and that it lacked the power to rule on the constitutionality of a statute.

762	"for his role in running an illegal lottery or ""bolita,"" efrain santos was convicted on charges of illegal gambling and money laundering. santos had used income from the lottery to pay both the winners and the couriers and collectors who worked for the gambling operation. the money laundering charges were based on 18 u.s.c. 1956(a)(1), which criminalizes the use of the ""proceeds"" of an illegal activity to promote or conceal that activity. however, federal courts disagreed on the meaning of ""proceeds."" the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit had ruled that the proceeds used in money laundering can be any of the gross income obtained from the illegal activity, but the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit, which had jurisdiction over santos's case, had recently ruled that only net income (gross revenues minus expenses) used to promote or conceal illegal activities can be the basis of a money laundering conviction. because santos had only used gross revenues to promote his lottery, the district court reversed the convictions.
the government argued on appeal that the seventh circuit's interpretation would put too great a burden on prosecutions, because the bookkeeping of criminal operations is often purposefully incomplete or misleading in order to obscure the distinction between gross and net income. the narrow interpretation would also restrict money laundering prosecutions to criminal enterprises that are actually profitable. santos countered that the government's broad interpretation would result in overlapping convictions for a wide variety of offenders charged with both money laundering and the underlying crime. he argued that the government's interpretation strayed too far from the traditional understanding of money laundering, which focuses on the subsequent disguising of profits obtained from a criminal venture. the seventh circuit ruled for santos and affirmed its original ruling."

the district court ruled for arco, finding that even if usa could prove the conspiracy, it would not be an ""antitrust injury"" to usa under the clayton act unless it could also prove that the pricing was predatory (that is, that it was intended to drive usa and other competitors out of business). it would be impossible to prove this, the district court concluded, because arco was not dominant enough in the market to exert that sort of power.

in the sixth trial, flowers was tried again and convicted for all four murders.
flowers appealed his conviction on several grounds, one of which was that the state violated his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights during the jury selection process by exercising its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory way. the prosecution had struck five african american prospective jurors. the mississippi supreme court rejected flowers’s arguments as to the jury selection, but the us supreme court ordered the court to reconsider in light of its ruling in foster v. chatman, 578 u.s. ___ (2016), where it held that the defendant in a capital case had shown intentional discrimination in the selection of jurors. on remand to the state supreme court, the court again upheld the ruling for the state. flowers again sought review by the us supreme court, and the court granted certiorari as to the question whether the mississippi supreme court erred in how it applied batson v. kentucky, 476 us 79 (1986)."

four months after he was convicted and sentenced, garza filed a petition for post-conviction relief in each case, alleging that his trial attorney was ineffective for not filing notices of appeal. garza’s attorney stated in an affidavit that he did not file an appeal because garza had waived his right to appeal by accepting the plea agreements. the district court dismissed garza’s petition to open the appeals period on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the appellate court affirmed the dismissal.
under roe v. flores-ortega, 528 u.s. 470 (2000), criminal defendants have a sixth amendment right to “reasonably effective” legal assistance. a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show: (1) that counsel’s representation was deficient; and (2) that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. generally, counsel’s failure to file an appeal at a criminal defendant’s request is professionally unreasonable and therefore deficient, and most federal circuit courts interpret flores-ortega to mean that attorneys are ineffective when they do not file an appeal if the clients requested it, regardless of whether the defendants had waived their rights.
the idaho supreme court held contrary to the majority of federal circuit courts, finding that flores-ortega does not require an automatic “presumption of prejudice” when counsel declines to file an appeal in light of an appeal waiver. rather, the defendant must still show deficient performance and resulting prejudice."

on february 11, 1974, gamble signed a pro se complaint alleging that the prison subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment, made applicable to the states by the fourteenth. the district court dismissed gamble’s complaint for failure to state a claim. the united states court of appeals, fifth circuit, reversed, noting that the prison failed to diagnose gamble’s back injury by giving him an x-ray, that the prison provided no real treatment for gamble’s back injury, and that gamble was essentially placed in solitary confinement due to substandard medical care."

780	jevic transportation, inc. was a trucking company headquartered in new jersey that in 2006 was purchased by a subsidiary of sun capital partners. in 2008, jevic filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code; at that point, it owed about $53 million to its first-priority senior secured creditors and about $20 million to its tax and general unsecured creditors. two lawsuits ensued in bankruptcy court: one was the truck drivers suing jevic for violating federal and state worker adjustment and retraining notification acts, which required 60 days’ notice to workers before they were laid off, and the other was a fraudulent conveyance action on behalf of the unsecured creditors. in march 2012, the parties to the fraudulent conveyance action negotiated a structured dismissal settlement that disposed of many of the claims, but left out the drivers. the drivers objected to the settlement because it distributed property to creditors of lower priority than the drivers, according to the priorities established in the bankruptcy code. the bankruptcy court rejected the objections and approved the proposed settlement. the federal district court and the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit affirmed and held that the bankruptcy court had the discretion to approve a settlement scheme outside of the chapter 11 proceedings that did not comply with the bankruptcy code’s distribution scheme.

781	"north dakota was a sparsely populated state, and as late as the mid-20th century some children were educated in crowded one-room schools. since 1947, the legislature encouraged thinly populated school districts to reorganize themselves into larger districts; once reorganized, districts could only charge for transportation provisions with voter approval. dickinson public schools chose not to participate in the reorganization. in 1973, the district began charging a fee for door-to-door bus service; about thirteen percent of students rode the bus, and the district charged their parents ninety-seven dollars a year for one child or one hundred fifty dollars a year for two children. in 1979, north dakota enacted legislation expressly indicating that non-reorganized school districts could charge fees for transporting students.
sarita kadrmas, her mother paula, and the rest of her family lived about sixteen miles from sarita’s school. in september 1985, the family’s annual income was at or near the poverty level. until 1985, the kadrmas family agreed each year to pay the busing fee for sarita, but they refused to sign a contract for the 1985 school year and the bus no longer stopped for sarita. the kadrmas family then used private transportation, but the costs exceeded $1,000 per school year.
in september 1985, paula kadrmas and other parents in the district filed an action in state court seeking to enjoin the dickinson public schools and various school district officials from collecting any bus service fees. the district court rejected their action on the merits. on appeal to the supreme court of north dakota, rejected kadrmas’ argument that the busing fee violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. it characterized the statute as purely economic legislation, concluding that the charges authorized by the statute were rationally related to the legitimate government objective of allocating limited resources. in the spring of 1987, while her appeal to the supreme court of the united states was pending, the kadrmas family signed a busing contract for the remainder of the 1986 school year and paid part of the fee. they also signed a contract for the 1987 school year."

799	"this case arises from montana’s anaconda smelter site—the location of a large copper concentrating and smelting operation that started in 1884 and expanded to other nearby areas in 1902. in 1977, atlantic richfield purchased anaconda smelter, and it shut down smelter activities in 1980. the smelter operations over the almost-century of operations caused high concentrations of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium, and zinc to contaminate soil, groundwater, and surface water. in 1983, the epa prioritized the anaconda smelter site as a superfund site, working with atlantic richfield to address the contamination. since then, atlantic richfield has worked with the epa for 35 years to remediate the site, at a cost of approximately $470 million.
in 2008, landowners within the anaconda superfund site sued atlantic richfield in montana state court, alleging that the smelter operations between 1884 and 1980 had caused damage to their properties. atlantic richfield raised no objections to the plaintiffs’ claims of loss of use and enjoyment of property, diminution of value, incidental and consequential damages, and annoyance and discomfort. however, it did object to the common-law claim for “restoration” damages.
to establish a claim for restoration damages in montana, plaintiffs must prove that they will actually use the award to clean up the site. the plaintiffs in this case alleged that restoration of their property requires “work in excess of what the epa required of atlantic richfield in its selected remedy.” atlantic richfield moved for summary judgment, arguing that the restoration claim constituted a “challenge” to the epa’s remedy and thus was jurisdictionally barred by cercla § 113, which deprives courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to epa-selected remedies. atlantic richfield also argued that the landowners are “potentially responsible parties” and thus must seek epa approval under 42 u.s.c. § 9622(e)(6) of cercla before engaging in remedial action. finally, atlantic richfield argued that cercla preempted state common-law claims for restoration.
the trial court held that cercla permitted plaintiffs’ claim for restoration damages, and atlantic richfield sought a writ of supervisory control from the montana supreme court, which the court granted. over a dissent, the supreme court of montana rejected all three of atlantic richfield’s arguments, affirming the trial court’s decision permitting the plaintiffs to proceed to a jury trial on their restoration claim."

800	"sam umans was a certified public accountant. between 1959 and 1961, the internal revenue service audited six couples represented by umans. according to louis r. deitsch, an irs employee, umans approached deitsch before each audit to “work something out together on it”. they agreed upon a disallowance for each audit and umans gave deitsch an envelope containing $50 for each case. five other irs employees described similar transactions between the years 1961 and 1963, wherein smaller disallowances were given during audits followed by cash payments to the auditing irs employees.
umans and the six irs employees, including deitsch, were indicted in august 1964. umans was charged with aiding and abetting irs employees in receiving illegal fees.  he was also charged with giving money to government officials. on march 25, 1965, umans and the six irs employees were re-indicted.  the grand jury additionally charged umans with giving money to government officials with the intent to influence their actions. the evidence before the grand jury consisted solely of an irs agent summarizing statements made by witnesses who would later testify at umans’ trial. at trial, umans requested access to statements made by the irs employees that they took bribes from persons other than umans; the court denied this request and sealed the documents in question. the government’s case was based almost entirely on the testimonies of three of the irs employees, including that of deitsch.
judge sterry r. waterman, writing for a unanimous united states court of appeals, second circuit, held that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the intent element of umans’ charge for aiding and abetting irs employees, but that this instruction was not in plain error. he held that the instruction was not sufficiently prejudicial, noting that it was not objected to at trial. judge waterman did, however, reverse the sentence for giving money to officials, holding that this sentence could not be concurrent with the sentence for giving money to officials with intent to influence their actions. he noted that the charges were identical but for the higher requirement of proof in the latter charge. looking to the statute itself, judge waterman determined that congress intended to make the charge for giving money to officials a lesser, included offense.
judge waterman held that the trial court properly excluded the irs employees’ statements about taking bribes from other persons from the record. he reasoned that it would have been within the court’s discretion to prevent umans from cross-examining the irs employees on this subject for impeachment purposes, as the government did not broach the subject during the employees’ direct examination. judge waterman also held that the government properly indicted umans with hearsay evidence, holding that this evidence was competent. he dismissed umans’ concerns about inconsistencies between the evidence presented to the grand jury and evidence presented at trial. he noted that umans had access to affadavits used by the government to indict him; thus, he could have objected to any inconsistencies at trial, but did not do so."

doe’s guardian ad litem, rochelle garza, filed a putative class action challenging the constitutionality of orr’s policy on behalf of doe and “all other pregnant unaccompanied minors in orr custody.” on october 18, 2017, the district court issued a temporary restraining order (tro) permitting doe to have an abortion immediately. the next day, doe attended pre-abortion counseling, which was required under texas law to take place at least 24 hours in advance of the procedure, and with the same doctor who would perform the abortion.

the details of the subsequent events were disputed, but the government, under the impression that the soonest the abortion would happen was october 26, informed garza’s counsel that they planned to appeal the new order early on the morning of october 25. however, the same doctor who conducted doe’s pre-abortion counseling became available for her october 25 appointment, so the appointment was moved up to 4:15 a.m. and doe had the abortion instead of repeating the counseling with a new doctor.

the united states consulate continued to process visas for ""screened-out"" applicants until 1993, when the state department specifically instructed the consulate to buttress hong kong's immigration policy by sending ""screened-out"" applicants back to vietnam. two applicants claimed that the department had violated the immigration and nationality act (ina) by denying visas to a class of applicants on the basis of their nationality and place of residence (8 u.s.c. 1152(a)). a district court held that the case was moot and granted summary judgment to the state department.

the eighth circuit held that the prosecutors were not immune from claims that they violated mr. mcghee's and mr. harrington's due process rights. the court reasoned that allegations that prosecutors obtained, manufactured, coerced, and fabricated evidence did not fall within ""a distinctly prosecutorial function"" and thus the prosecutors were not immune to the claims."

812	in 2009, while antonio hinojosa was serving a 16-year sentence for armed robbery and related crimes, prison officials determined that he was a prison-gang associate and placed him in a secured housing unit. at that time, california law allowed prisoners placed in a secured housing unit solely because of prison-gang affiliation could continue to accrue good-time credits. in 2010, the california legislature amended the law so that, while prisoners in secured housing units could retain whatever good-time credits they had upon entry, they could no longer accrue good-time credits while in the unit. hinojosa filed a state habeas petition and argued that the amended law’s application to him violated the ex post facto clause of the u.s. constitution. the state court denied the claim because hinojosa did not file it in the court for the county in which he was incarcerated. hinojosa sought review by the appellate court and then the state supreme court, both of which denied his petition. hinojosa then sought federal habeas relief. the district court denied relief under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act (aedpa), which establishes a deferential standard of review of state denials of habeas, but the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed. the appellate court held that, because the initial state court denial was not based on the merits, the aedpa did not apply.

818	"troy lambert purchased an alleged aphrodisiac dietary supplement that was manufactured by nutraceutical, but that had not been approved by the food and drug administration (fda). based on the product’s labels, lambert believed that the supplement would enhance his sexual performance, and had he known these claims were false, he would not have purchased the product. 
lambert believed that the product violated fda regulations because it purported to increase sexual desire but had not been through clinical testing, and because it was not fda-approved. he further alleged that the product illegally failed to prominently display this lack of fda approval on its labeling, and that the labeling also failed to mention a potentially dangerous ingredient. lambert filed a consumer class action under federal rule of civil procedure (frcp) 23(b)(3), alleging state law claims related to unfair competition, false advertising, and other violations.
the district court granted class certification based on the full refund damages model, which applies when a product is useless and involves calculating the average retail price and the number of units sold. the judge hearing the case retired, and lambert’s action was reassigned to a new judge. discovery was completed, and nutraceutical filed a motion for decertification. the new judge granted the motion, finding that lambert had failed to provide essential evidence to apply his classwide damages model, meaning that common issues did not predominate as required under rule 23(b)(3). 
ten days after the order was issued decertifying the class, lambert informed the court that he intended to file a motion for reconsideration, and the court instructed him to file the motion within ten days, which was twenty days after the decertification order. in accordance with the court’s instructions, lambert filed his motion for reconsideration ten days later, highlighting evidence from his class certification motion that could be used to support the full refund damages model. he also offered an alternative damages model for the first time, based on non-restitutionary engorgement. 
three months later, the court denied his motion for reconsideration, rejecting his proposed damages models. lambert timely filed a petition under rule 23(f) for permission to appeal the district court’s orders denying the motion for reconsideration and granting the motion for class decertification to the 9th circuit, which conditionally granted his petition.
a three-judge panel of the 9th circuit held that lambert’s rule 23(f) petition for class certification had been timely filed with the appellate court. the court explained that because rule 23(f)’s 14-day deadline was procedural rather than jurisdictional, equitable exceptions such as tolling could apply. it also held that filing a motion for reconsideration before the rule 23(f) deadline would toll the deadline. the panel further held that other circumstances could toll the deadline. in this case, lambert had informed the district court of his intention to file a motion for reconsideration within rule 23(f)’s 14-day window, and had submitted the filing within the ten-day time frame set by that court. the panel concluded that under these circumstances the deadline should be tolled and lambert’s motion for reconsideration should be considered timely filed with the ninth circuit, while recognizing that a number of other circuits would likely reach the opposite conclusion."

fti consulting, inc., as trustee of the litigation trust that includes valley view as one of the debtors, brought this lawsuit against merit management group, a 30% shareholder in bedford downs. fti seeks to avoid bedford's $16.5 million transfer to valley view under bankruptcy code sections 544, 548(a)(1)(b), and 550, which are safe harbor provisions for transfers ""made by or to"" certain enumerated entities. it is undisputed that credit suisse and citizens bank are financial institutions within the language of the statute, but at issue is whether the language “made by or to” includes institutions that act merely as a conduit for the transfer and do not benefit from it.
the seventh circuit held that section 546(e) does not provide a safe harbor against avoidance of transfers between non-named entities where a named entity merely acts as a conduit for the transfer. the eleventh circuit has interpreted the provision in the same way as the seventh, while the second, third, sixth, eighth, and tenth circuits have held to the contrary."

before trial and as part of discovery, mr. carpenter requested information from mohawk related to his meeting with its attorney. mohawk contended that the information was protected by the attorney-client privilege. the federal district court ordered mohawk to disclose the information, but permitted the company to appeal. on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the order for discovery. it reasoned that while the supreme court's decision in cohen v. beneficial industrial loan corp. provided an exception to the finality requirement necessary for an appellate court to have jurisdiction over appeals, the appeal of a discovery order involving attorney-client privilege did not qualify for exception."

829	"in 1986, during the reagan administration's anti-drug initiative, congress enacted a federal sentencing policy of punishing crimes involving crack cocaine at a 100-to-1 ratio compared to crimes involving powder cocaine. for example, the sentencing guidelines prescribe the same sentence for a defendant convicted of dealing 500 grams of powder cocaine as they do for a defendant convicted of dealing only five grams of crack cocaine. congress declined to repeal the 100-to-1 ratio despite the u.s. sentencing commission's contention that the ratio led to exaggerated sentences for crack dealers.
derrick kimbrough pleaded guilty to distributing fifty or more grams of crack cocaine, along with other drug-and firearm-related offenses. the federal sentencing guidelines prescribed a sentence of between 19 and 22.5 years, but the district court judge considered this sentence ""ridiculous."" citing the sentencing commission's reports, the judge decided to depart from the 100-to-1 ratio and hand down a sentence of 15 years. since the supreme court's decision in united states v. booker the sentencing guidelines have been advisory only, but the guidelines range is still among the factors a court must consider before handing down a reasonable sentence.
on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit rejected the below-guidelines sentence as unreasonable. the fourth circuit ruled that trial judges act unreasonably when they depart from the guidelines on the basis of a disagreement with a congressional sentencing policy. therefore, judges cannot hand down below-guidelines sentences merely in order to avoid the sentencing disparity caused by the 100-to-1 ratio."

after this adverse ruling, ritzen filed two appeals in the district court. the first appeal arose from the bankruptcy court’s order denying relief from the automatic stay (which ritzen did not appeal at the time). the second appeal arose from the bankruptcy court’s determination that ritzen, not jackson, breached the contract. the district court ruled against ritzen on both appeals; the first appeal was untimely filed, and the second one failed on the merits.

both the district court and the fifth circuit rejected his claim, the fifth circuit stating that rothgery's sixth amendment rights were not implicated because no prosecutor was present at the initial hearing. in his petition for certiorari, rothgery argued that both federal and state case law indicate that the sixth amendment right to counsel applies to any hearing where a defendant is advised of his rights and the charges against him, regardless of whether or not a prosecutor is present."

esparza then filed a second appeal before the court of appeals, this time arguing that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during his first appeal. he specifically cited his attorney's failure to argue that the state had violated the eighth amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by not following the ""letter of the law"" in its sentencing. the court again rejected esparza's argument, referring back to its first decision and holding that the prosecutor's error had been harmless and was therefore not grounds for overturning the sentence. the defense attorney's failure to raise eighth amendment objections to the prosecutor's error, therefore, was also harmless.
esparza then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, raising the same ineffective assistance of counsel claim. in response, ohio argued that the ohio appeals court's decision had not violated ""clearly established federal law"" and that the district court therefore could not overturn the sentence. the court sided with esparza, however, holding that the state's failure to follow its sentencing laws violated the eighth amendment. the attorney's failure to raise the eighth amendment claim in the first appeal, therefore, was not harmless and could serve as grounds for overturning the sentence. a sixth circuit court of appeals panel affirmed the federal district court's opinion."

in march, the union tried to establish a procedure to collectively bargain for the employees of the various hotels. it could not reach an agreement between the employee representatives from each hotel, so it addressed a letter to the miami beach hotel association requesting a conference. it also sent copies to each hotel and published copies in local newspapers. the association -- which was not specifically authorized to bargain for its members -- did not answer the union’s request. in response, on april 13, 1955, the union began a strike at nine hotels, including the sherry frontenac.
the hotels filed for an injunction against the picketers. of the nine cases, the district court tried seven separately, with each judge retaining jurisdiction over his particular case. in each of the seven cases, the trial judge held that there was not enough evidence of violence to justify enjoining the picketing on that basis. before each court could address whether the unions were coercing hotel employees to unionize, however, the florida supreme court intervened. on the basis of the hotels’ complaint, it held that the real purpose of the strike was indeed to coerce hotel employees to join the union, in violation of florida law."

880	"on november 11, 1983, fbi agent russell anderson, along with other state and federal officers, conducted a warrantless search of the creighton family home based on the belief that vadaain dixon, a man suspected of robbing a bank earlier that day, was hiding in the house. the creightons sued anderson in minnesota state court and filed a claim for monetary damages under the fourth amendment. the suit was removed to federal district court, where anderson moved for dismissal or summary judgment based on his alleged qualified immunity from civil damages liability. qualified immunity shields government officials from liability for certain violations of an individual’s constitutional rights. the district court granted summary judgment for anderson after finding that the search was lawful because anderson had probable cause.
the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit reversed and held that the case could not be decided on summary judgment because there were unresolved factual disputes regarding the legality of the search. the court of appeals also held that that anderson did not have qualified immunity because the right he allegedly violated was the well-established fourth amendment right to protection from warrantless searches of a home."

881	"in july 2003, the transportation security administration (tsa) learned of a potential plot to hijack us planes and briefed the federal air marshals accordingly. not long after that briefing, the tsa notified the marshals that all missions on flights from las vegas would be cancelled until august. federal air marshal robert j. maclean became concerned that the tsa was not appropriately responding to the threat and creating a danger to the flying public, so he contacted an msnbc reporter about the situation in an attempt to create a public controversy. msnbc published an article, and several members of congress joined in criticizing the decision to cancel the missions. that decision was then rescinded. in 2004, maclean appeared disguised on nbc night news, and some tsa employees recognized his voice. during the course of the investigation that followed, maclean revealed his role in the 2003 msnbc article. this contact was deemed to be an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive security information, and maclean was removed from his position.
maclean challenged the determination that he disclosed sensitive security information before the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit. maclean argued that the information about the cancellation of missions was not classified at the time he received it and could not be retroactively classified. the court of appeals held that the tsa had simply applied regulations already in force in 2003 to determine that information should fall under that classification. maclean also challenged his removal before the merit systems protection board (board) and argued that his actions were protected under the whistleblower protection act (wpa). the board determined that maclean's actions did not fall under the wpa because they were explicitly prohibited by law. the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the board's ruling and held that maclean's actions were not explicitly prohibited by law under the wpa."

on march 2, 1986, jeffrey alan walton, robert hoover, and sharold ramsey went to a bar in tucson intending to rob someone at random and steal that individual’s car. the three robbed thomas powell at gunpoint and forced him into his car that they drove into the desert. they later stopped the car, forced powell to lie on the ground, and walton shot him in the head. after the body was found, the coroner determined that the shot did not kill powell, but rather that he died from dehydration, starvation, and pneumonia from being left in the desert. walton was convicted of first-degree murder.
at the sentencing hearing, the prosecution argued that two aggravating factors were present: the murder was committed in “an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner” and for the purposes of financial gain. the defense argued that mitigating factors were present in the form of walton’s history of substance abuse, possible sexual abuse as a child, and the fact that he was 20 years old at the time of the trial. the court found that the aggravating factors were present, and the judge sentenced walton to death. the arizona supreme court affirmed.

donna newman, who had represented him while he was being held as a material witness, filed a petition for habeas corpus on his behalf. the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york ruled that newman had standing to file the petition despite the fact that padilla had been moved to a military brig in south carolina. however, the court also found that the department of defense, under the president's constitutional powers as commander in chief and the statutory authorization provided by congress's authorization for use of military force, had the power to detain padilla as an enemy combatant. the district judge rejected newman's argument that the detention was prohibited by the federal non-detention act, which states that no ""citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the united states except pursuant to an act of congress.""
on appeal, a divided second circuit court of appeals panel reversed the district court's ""enemy combatant"" ruling. the panel found that the authorization for use of military force did not meet the requirement of the non-detention act and that the president could not, therefore, declare american citizens captured outside a combat zone as enemy combatants."

the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit held that the creation of the public company accounting oversight board did not violate either the appointments clause or the separation of powers principle. it reasoned that the board's members were inferior officers under the supervision of the sec and thus were not obligated to be appointed by the president. also, the court noted that the president's ability to remove members of the sec, who in turn could remove members of the board, preserved the constitution's separation of powers."

smith appealed and argued the judge's reversal of the not guilty ruling on the possession charge violated the fifth amendment's doubly jeopardy clause, which prohibited successive prosecutions. the state court of appeals rejected smith's argument and ruled no fifth amendment violation occurred because the judge's reversal did not require a second proceeding."

the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit reversed, allowing holowecki's suit to go forward. the second circuit ruled that the minimal written information required for a charge was contained in the intake questionnaire. the questionnaire also met the adea's implicit requirement that the charge be intended to start the process of an adea suit. the second circuit did not consider it significant that the eeoc did not act on the questionnaire, apparently not believing it to count as a charge. to dismiss a complaint based on the eeoc's inaction would be to hold the plaintiff accountable for the failings of the agency."

a u.s. district court ruled that the school district was not required by the idea to reimburse freston, because gilbert had never been enrolled in public school. the relevant section of the idea authorizes tuition reimbursement to the parents of a disabled child ""who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency,"" but it does not explicitly state that parents of children who have never received public education are not entitled to reimbursement. the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the district court. by comparing the disputed section of the idea with other sections of the statute, the second circuit reasoned that the idea was not meant to deny reimbursement to students who have never been enrolled in public school. to rule otherwise, the circuit court held, would be to require parents like freston to enroll children in inadequate public schools in order to be eligible for tuition reimbursement."

under federal law, a generic burglary is “an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.” michigan law defines the crime of third-degree home invasion as breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a misdemeanor in the dwelling, entering the dwelling without permission with intent to commit a misdemeanor in the dwelling, or breaking and entering a dwelling and while entering or present in the dwelling, committing a misdemeanor. this third option of intent is the subject of the present dispute. both the district court and the sixth circuit found unpersuasive quarles’s argument that the michigan crime lacks the intent-upon-entry element that is required under generic burglary. under binding sixth circuit precedent, generic burglary does not require intent at entry, so the michigan crime of third-degree home invasion is not broader than the crime of generic burglary."

918	"on february 20, 1987, consolidated rail corporation (""conrail"") announced its decision to include drug screening in all periodic and return-to-duty examinations. conrail had always enforced rule g of its agreement with its unionized employees, which forbids the use or possession of ""intoxicants, narcotics, amphetamines or hallucinogens"" by its employees. previously, it routinely used drug screening urinalysis as part of return-to-duty medical examinations of employees with drug-related problems and in other examinations where the examining physician suspected drug use.
the railway labor executives' association (""rlea"")-- comprised of individuals in leadership positions at more than eighteen craft unions-- filed suit against conrail, alleging that conrail violated section 6 of the railway labor act (""rla""). the rla, passed in 1926 and amended in 1934, created the national railroad adjustment board, an arbitration board designed to settle minor disputes between railroad companies and labor organizations. under sections 5 and 6 of the rla, major disputes require an extensive mediation and conciliation process.
district court judge anthony j. scirica found that the dispute was ""minor"" under the railway labor act because conrail's decision was arguably justified by the terms of its agreement with the unions, and that the court had no jurisdiction over the dispute. judge dolores sloviter of the u.s. court of appeals, 3rd circuit reversed. judge sloviter rejected the district court's conclusion that conrail's prior use of medical examinations arguably justified unilaterally changing its drug testing policy. the appeals court held that the dispute was ""major"" because it changed the terms and conditions governing employment relationships."

the district court determined that motels were not subjected to the same kind of pervasive and regular regulations as other recognized ""closely regulated"" businesses. nonetheless, the court held that motels do not have an ownership interest that gives rise to a privacy right in their records because the records were created to comply with the ordinance. the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit initially affirmed, but later reversed in rehearing en banc. the appellate court held that the hotel records were private ""papers"" protected by the fourth amendment and that the lamc's warrantless search provision was unreasonable because it does not provide for pre-compliance judicial review of an officer's demand to inspect a motel's records."

921	"after world war ii, the united states made funds available through the ‘marshall plan’ to many countries to pay for commodities sold by american companies and shipped from the united states and other free-world sources. congress made foreign aid funds available to bring commodities to the republic of korea, beginning with the mutual security act of 1954.
in 1961, the concentrated phosphate export association (cpea) organized to act as an export-selling agency for the concentrated phosphate products of its member corporations. cpea organized under the webb-pomerene act, which congress passed to help american firms compete with foreign cartels. the process began when congress allocated funds to various agency for international development (aid) programs. the united states thus directly financed the purchase of commodities allocated to korea, approved via a complicated, tightly regulated application procedure. the united states assigned two of the cpea contracts, and the republic of korea assigned the other nine, subject to detailed regulation by aid. the contracts only circulated in the united states.
the united states filed an action to enjoin price fixing and business allocation activities among the cpea’s five major member corporations. the district court held that cpea’s sales were ‘export trade’ for the purposes of the sherman act; hence, although cpea conceded that its members were coordinating their sales actions, cpea did not violate the sherman act. on january 1, 1967, the state department amended its regulations to preclude webb-pomerene associations from bidding on contracts where the procurement was limited to united states suppliers; in response, the cpea dissolved on december 28, 1967, despite the district court’s favorable ruling."

the federal district court agreed, rejecting the argument of new hampshire's attorney general that the judicial bypass procedure included in the law, in which a judge could approve an abortion without parental notification for a minor who showed she was mature enough to make the decision on her own, could be used to permit abortions necessary to protect the health of the mother. the judge also rejected new hampshire's argument that the law could not be challenged until it had actually been implemented. a first circuit court of appeals panel unanimously affirmed the decision."

epa denied the petition, claiming that the clean air act does not authorize the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. even if it did, epa argued, the agency had discretion to defer a decision until more research could be done on ""the causes, extent and significance of climate change and the potential options for addressing it."" massachusetts appealed the denial of the petition to the court of appeals for the d.c. circuit, and a divided panel ruled in favor of epa."

[a] drug trafficking crime[,] uses . . . a firearm."" a jury convicted smith on all counts, which triggered the sentence enhancement. on appeal, smith argued that the federal penalty for using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense covers only situations in which the firearm is used as a weapon, not as a medium of exchange. the court of appeals disagreed. it held that the plain language of the penalty does not require that a firearm be used as a weapon, but that it applies to any use of a gun that facilitates, in any fashion, the perpetration of a drug offense."

following the indictment, the district court issued a protective order preventing the kaleys from transferring or disposing of any property in the forfeiture count. the kaleys moved to vacate the order because it prevented them from hiring their attorneys in violation of their right to counsel protected by the sixth amendment to the u.s. constitution. the district court denied their motion without granting a pretrial evidentiary hearing. the kaleys appealed to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit, which reversed and remanded.
on remand, the district court granted a pretrial hearing, but limited it to the question of whether the property in the forfeiture count was traceable to the kaleys' offenses. when the kaleys failed to present evidence regarding traceability, the district court refused to vacate the protective order. the kaleys appealed again, arguing that they should have been allowed to challenge the validity of the indictment in the pretrial hearing. the appellate court disagreed and affirmed the lower court's decision."

in 1996, jennings filed a state habeas petition and argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at the punishment phase because his attorneys had failed to contact his family to provide evidence of a disadvantaged background and had failed to find and present a 1978 psychological report that suggested that jennings had a ""mild organic brain dysfunction."" the state court held that jennings' attorneys had conducted a sufficient investigation into his background, and that their decision not to introduce this testimony and evidence was a reasonable trial strategy. the state court recommended that the texas court of criminal appeals deny the request for habeas relief, and the texas court of criminal appeals acted accordingly.
in 2009, jennings filed a federal habeas petition with the district court. the district court granted the petition and held that jennings had received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed to present evidence of his disadvantaged background and possible mental incapacities. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed and held that jennings' counsel's decision not to pursue these avenues of argument was a legitimate trial strategy. the court of appeals also held that a federal habeas petitioner must file a certificate of appealability in order to respond to arguments concerning the state's appeal."

969	"lois davis was an information technology (it) supervisor for fort bend county, texas. she filed a complaint with the county human resources department alleging that the it director had sexually harassed and assaulted her, and following an investigation by the county, the director resigned. davis alleges that after the director’s resignation, her supervisor—who was a personal friend of the director—retaliated against her for making the complaint.
davis filed a charge with the texas workforce commission alleging sexual harassment and retaliation. while the charge was pending, davis allegedly informed her supervisor of a specific sunday she could not work due to a “previous religious commitment,” and the supervisor did not approve the absence. davis attended the event and did not report to work, and fort bend terminated her employment.
davis submitted to the commission an “intake questionnaire” in which she wrote in the word “religion” next to a checklist labeled “employment harms or actions” but did not amend her charge of discrimination or explain the note. the commission informed davis that it had made a preliminary decision to dismiss her charge and issued a right-to-sue letter. davis filed her lawsuit in federal district court alleging both retaliation and religious discrimination under title vii. the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county on all claims.
the fifth circuit affirmed the lower court as to the retaliation claim but reversed and remanded as to her religious discrimination claim, finding genuine disputes of material fact that warranted a trial. on remand, fort bend argued for the first time that davis had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies on the religious discrimination claim, as required by title vii. the district court agreed, finding that administrative exhaustion is a jurisdictional prerequisite in title vii cases. because subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by failure to challenge it, the district court dismissed davis’s religious discrimination claim with prejudice.
title vii requires plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies by filing formal charges with the eeoc. there is no consensus within the fifth circuit whether this requirement is a jurisdictional requirement (which may be raised at any point and cannot be waived) or merely a prerequisite to suit (and thus subject to waiver). relying on the supreme court’s decision in arbaugh v. y &amp; h corp., 546 u.s. 500 (2006), in which the court held that the title vii’s statutory limitation of covered employers to those with 15 or more employees was not jurisdictional, the fifth circuit held that the administrative exhaustion requirement was also not jurisdictional. this holding is consistent with holdings in the first, second, third, sixth, seventh, tenth, and dc circuits, but inconsistent with holdings by the fourth, ninth, and eleventh circuits."

the louisiana supreme court affirmed the imposition of the death sentence, noting that although the u.s. supreme court had struck down capital punishment for rape of an adult woman in coker v. georgia, that ruling did not apply when the victim was a child. rather the louisiana high court applied a balancing test set out by the court in atkins v. virginia and roper v. simmons, first examining whether there is a national consensus on the punishment and then considering whether the court would find the punishment excessive. in this case, the louisiana supreme court felt that the adoption of similar laws in five other states, coupled with the unique vulnerability of children, justified imposing the death penalty.
in seeking certiorari, kennedy argued that five states do not constitute a ""national consensus"" for the purposes of eighth amendment analysis, that coker v. georgia should apply to all rapes regardless of the age of the victim, and that the law was unfair in its application, singling out black child rapists for death at a significantly higher rate than whites."

during the trial, the court conducted a voir dire examination of the younger daughter, aged three years at the time of the trial, to determine whether she was capable of testifying. the court found, and the parties agreed, that she was not. over the objection of the defense, the court allowed dr. jambura to testify to certain statements the younger daughter made during the examination. laura wright and giles were convicted on both counts, and they appealed on the conviction regarding the conduct with the younger daughter. they argued that the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of dr. jambura. the idaho supreme court held that the admission of the hearsay testimony violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment because the testimony did not fall under a hearsay exception and the interview in question lacked procedural safeguards. the idaho supreme court also noted that children are highly susceptible to suggestion and can easily be influenced by leading questions. because the idaho supreme court was not convinced that the jury would have reached the same conclusion had the testimony been excluded, it reversed the conviction."

on appeal, a motions panel denied the government's motion to transfer to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit. it held that bormes' complaint invoked the district court's jurisdiction under the little tucker act; the little tucker act grants jurisdiction to district courts over claims against the united states not exceeding $10,000. afterwards, a panel of the seventh circuit determined that the little tucker act waives sovereign immunity for the fcra in talley v. u.s. department of agriculture. the seventh circuit later vacated this opinion; the talley case remains pending. bormes appealed his case to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit, which determined that the fcra mandates money damages from the federal government, giving jurisdiction to the district courts through the little tucker act."

planned parenthood sued the attorney general of the united states, arguing that the act was unconstitutional under the right to an abortion protected by the substantive component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment, as interpreted by the supreme court in roe v. wade and subsequent cases. the district court agreed and stopped the act from going into effect.
on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed. though the government claimed that the act banned only a narrow, rare category of abortions, the circuit court ruled that the act applied to the common abortion procedure known as ""d&amp;e"" (""dilation and evacuation""), as well as to the far less common ""intact d&amp;e,"" sometimes called ""d&amp;x"" (""dilation and extraction""). this made the ban expansive enough to qualify as an unconstitutional ""undue burden"" on the right to abortion, as defined in planned parenthood v. casey.
the ninth circuit also ruled that the act's lack of an exception for abortions necessary to protect the health of the mother rendered it unconstitutional. congress had included in the act a finding that partial-birth abortions were never medically necessary, but the ninth circuit held that the supreme court's decision in stenberg v. carhart required the health exception in all cases where medical opinion on the necessity an abortion procedure is divided.

after their investigation, the san antonio police arrested trevino and a grand jury indicted him on one count of intentional murder and attempt to commit aggravated sexual assault. at trial, trevino's cousin gonzalez testified against him. gonzalez testified that the men returned to the car with blood on their shirts discussing the murder, with trevino bragging about how he learned to kill in prison. with this evidence, the jury found trevino guilty and was left to decide on an appropriate punishment. they determined that trevino intended to kill linda and was likely to commit such violent acts in the future. at the jury's suggestion, the trial court sentenced trevino to death.
through both the punishment phase of the trial and the first state habeas corpus proceeding, trevino's attorney did not investigate or present any mitigating evidence that could have reduced trevino's sentence. during the federal habeas proceeding that followed, trevino's attorney withdrew and the court appointed new counsel. trevino's new counsel undertook his own investigation and discovered several pieces of evidence that the jury could have found relevant during the punishment phase of the trial.
trevino returned to state court and filed a second habeas corpus application on the basis that his first attorney had a duty to investigate and present the mitigating evidence. since the attorney failed to do so, trevino claimed that his sixth amendment right to a competent attorney had been denied. the state court denied his application, stating that trevino should have presented the ineffective assistance of counsel claim during the first state habeas proceeding. trevino returned to the federal district court to reassert this claim, but that court also denied his claim because it was never properly raised in state court. the district court went on to explain that the allegedly ineffective performance of his first attorney during state habeas proceedings did not excuse his failure to present an ineffective assistance of counsel claim during those proceedings. the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed the district court's decision and trevino appealed further. the supreme court granted certiorari limited to the question below."

arizona law permits each county to choose a vote center or a precinct-based system for in-person voting. in counties using the vote-center system, registered voters may vote at any polling location in the county. in counties using the precinct-based system, registered voters may vote only at the designated polling place in their precinct. about 90% of arizona’s population lives in counties using the precinct-based system. if a voter arrives at a polling place and is not listed on the voter rolls for that precinct, the voter may cast a provisional ballot. after election day, election officials review all provisional ballots to determine the voter’s identity and address. if officials determine the voter voted out of precinct (oop), the county discards the ballot in its entirety, even if (as is the case in most instances), the oop voter properly voted (i.e., was eligible to vote) in most of the races on the ballot. the democratic national committee challenged this oop policy as violating section 2 of the voting rights act because it adversely and disparately affects arizona’s native american, hispanic, and african american citizens.
arizona law has permitted early voting for over 25 years, allowing voters to request an early vote-by-mail ballot either on a per-election basis or on a permanent basis. some counties permit voters to drop their early ballots in special drop boxes, but all counties permit the return of early ballots by mail, or in person at a polling place, vote center, or authorized election official’s office. many voters (particularly minorities) who vote early use third parties to collect and drop off voted ballots, which, until 2016, was permissible. despite “no evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-party ballot collection in arizona,” republican legislators in 2016 passed h.b. 2023, which criminalized the collection and delivery of another person’s ballot. the dnc challenged h.b. 2023 as violating section 2 of the voting rights act and the fifteenth amendment because it was enacted with discriminatory intent.

since those treaties, there have been recurring and ongoing disputes between the tribes and (originally) the white settlers there and (today) the state government itself. the present case arises from the tribes’ contention that the government was building and maintaining culverts (channels carrying water under roads or sidewalks) that diminished the size of salmon runs in traditional fishing areas for the tribes. the 20+ tribes represented in the suit allege that this diminishment amounts to violation of the fishing clause of the treaties.
washington contends that it constructed the culverts in a particular way according to federal law and that the federal requirement caused it to violate the treaties.

home depot filed a notice of removal in federal court, citing federal jurisdiction under the class action fairness act (cafa). home depot then filed a motion to realign parties with jackson as plaintiff and home depot, cws, and citibank as defendants. jackson moved to remand the case to state court and amended his third-party complaint to remove any reference to citibank.
the district court denied home depot’s motion to realign parties, finding that there were not “antagonistic parties on the same side,” and granted jackson’s motion to remand because home depot was not a “defendant” eligible to remove under cafa. the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed, finding that the district court properly declined to realign the parties because the purpose of realignment—to prevent parties from fraudulently manufacturing diversity jurisdiction—was not implicated in the dispute. moreover, the fourth circuit found that allowing home depot to remove would be inconsistent with its prior interpretations of cafa’s removal statute."

on appeal, giles argued that use of the police conversation violated his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses against him, namely, his deceased ex-girlfriend. the california supreme court held that giles had waived this right because he was the cause of his ex-girlfriend's absence. although this exclusion was justified under common law rules of ""forfeiture by wrongdoing"", the supreme court had greatly constrained the admissibility of such evidence in its 2004 holding in crawford v. washington. crawford essentially wiped out the admissibility of such out-of-court statements unless the testimony could be subject to cross-examination at trial, an option that would be impossible under these circumstances. this case gives the court an opportunity to expand on its decision in crawford and to apply it to a situation where the wrongdoing that kept the witness from appearing in court was not motivated by a desire to prevent the witness' testimony."

nelson filed petition in federal district court alleging that the method of execution proposed by alabama violated his eighth amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment. alabama had notified nelson that, because of damage done to his veins by previous intravenous drug abuse, the execution procedure might require corrections officers to cut through muscles and fat in his arm to get access to a vein that could carry the toxins. he claimed that this was an inhumane method of execution and should therefore be barred. further, he argued that the petition was not an appeal of his conviction or sentence (appeals of both were prohibited by u.s. code title 28, section 2254, a federal law designed to limit the number of habeas corpus appeals by death row inmates) but rather a freestanding lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the proposed execution procedure. alabama countered that nelson's appeal was intended only to prolong his life through procedural delays, exactly what the federal law was designed to prevent, and should therefore be thrown out.
the federal district court agreed with alabama, holding that nelson's appeal dealt not just with the procedure but with the sentence itself. it was therefore functionally equivalent to a habeas corpus petition, which was barred by section 2254. a divided 11th circuit court of appeals panel affirmed the decision. after the 11th circuit declined to rehear the case as a whole (en banc), the u.s. supreme court issued a stay of execution and then accepted the case for appeal."

pursuant to congressional authorizations, the corps operates a system of dams in the acf basin based on a master manual governing all the dams and a reservoir regulation manual for each individual dam. the master manual was completed in 1958 and has not been comprehensively revised since then. there have been several lawsuits among the states seeking update and clarify the apportionment of the waters of the acf basin. the present action was filed by florida, which alleges that the ecosystem and economy of the apalachicola region ""are suffering serious harm"" because of georgia's consumption and storage of water from the basin. florida invokes the us supreme court's original jurisdiction to ask that the court equitably apportion the waters of the acf basin. for equitable relief to be granted, florida must first show standing—that is, that it has suffered a wrong through the action of another state that can be corrected by the courts. second, the state must show by clear and convincing evidence a ""threatened invasion of rights . . . of serious magnitude."" third, the state must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the benefits of apportionment substantially outweigh the harm that could result. if a state meets this burden, the court must craft an equitable-apportionment decree. after lengthy evidentiary hearings, the special master filed a report recommending that the court deny florida's request for relief on the ground that ""florida has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that its injury can be redressed by an order equitably apportioning the waters of the basin."""

when michigan attempted to exercise its regulatory powers over wachovia mortgage, wachovia bank sued watters, a michigan official, seeking a judgment that michigan's laws on operating subsidies of national banks were superceded by 12 u.s.c section 484(a). michigan argued that the occ had exceeded the authority given it by congress by extending the definition of ""national bank"" to cover state-registered operating subsidiaries. michigan also argued that the extension of federal authority over state entities like wachovia mortgage violates the tenth amendment, which reserves to states all powers not delegated to the federal government.
the district court rejected these arguments and ruled for wachovia, and the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed. the circuit court found that the decision of the occ to apply rules for national banks to their operating subsidiaries was a reasonable interpretation of congress's intent, and therefore entitled to deference under chevron u.s.a. v. natural resources defense council. the sixth circuit also held that congress had the power to regulate operating subsidiaries of national banks under the commerce clause, so the tenth amendment did not reserve that power to the states."

18 u.s.c. § 924(c) contains both an “elements clause” and a “residual clause.” the elements clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it “has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,” and the residual clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it, “by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.” in dimaya, the court addressed (and invalidated) a residual clause identical to the residual clause in § 924(c) but did not address the elements clause. thus, the fifth circuit held the residual clause in 924(c) unconstitutionally vague under dimaya but did not invalidate the elements clause in that section. as a result of this holding, the fifth circuit affirmed its prior judgment as to the hobbs act robbery count but vacated as to the aiding and abetting conspiracy count, because the former relies on the elements clause while the latter relies on the residual clause."

1156	"bruce weyhrauch was charged in the alaska federal district court in part with a ""scheme and artifice to defraud and deprive the state of alaska of its intangible right to [his] honest services."" mr. weyhrauch was a member of the alaska house of representatives and allegedly took actions favorable to an alaska oil company, veco corp., in return for future employment. at trial, mr. weyhrauch moved to exclude evidence related to the honest services charge. the district court excluded the evidence because it would merely have shown that alaska could have imposed a duty upon mr. weyhrauch to disclose the conflict of interest, and thus did not prove he had violated any duty imposed by state law.
on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed. it held that 18 u.s.c. section 1346 established a uniform standard for ""honest services"" that governs every public official and that the government did not need to prove an independent violation of state law to sustain an honest services fraud conviction. therefore, the court reasoned that because the district court excluded the evidence needed to prove that state law imposed an affirmative duty on mr. weyhrauch to disclose the conflict of interest, the evidence was admissible."

the district court refused to answer the question of whether the declaration of ""enemy combatant"" was sufficient to justify his detention without review of materials and criteria used in making the determination. it ordered the government to produce these materials for a review by the court. not wanting to produce these materials, the government appealed. the fourth circuit court of appeals panel reversed, finding that the separation of powers required federal courts to practice restraint during wartime because ""the executive and legislative branches are organized to supervise the conduct of overseas conflict in a way that the judiciary simply is not."" the panel therefore found that it should defer to the executive branch's ""enemy combatant"" determination."

when the officers arrived at the residence, they knocked on the door but received no answer. through a side window, the officers spoke with emmons wife and convinced her to open the door so they could perform a welfare check. as officers were speaking with her, an unidentified man told emmons to back away from the window.
a few minutes later, and after additional officers had arrived, a man opened the apartment door and came outside. one of the officers told the man not to close the door, but the man closed the door and tried to walk past the officer. the officer stopped him, took him to the ground, and handcuffed him. police body-camera video shows that the officer did not hit the man or display any weapon, and that the man was not in any visible or audible pain either as a result of the takedown or while on the ground. minutes later, officers helped the man up and arrested him for the misdemeanor offense of resisting arrest and delaying a police officer.
the man turned out to be emmons’s father, marty emmons. marty emmons sued all of the police officers present and the city of escondido for use of excessive force, among other claims, in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments. the federal district court rejected the excessive force claim as to all but the officer who took down marty emmons. with respect to that officer, the district court found that the law was not clearly established that the officer could not act the way he did in that situation, so he was entitled to qualified immunity.
the ninth circuit reversed and remanded for trial on the excessive force claims against two of the officers, finding that the right to be free of excessive force was clearly established at the time of the events in question."	True

the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit upheld the lower court. the eighth circuit held that klehr should have discovered the pattern of racketeering activity much earlier. since the statute of limitations began from the time klehr could reasonably be expected to have discovered the pattern, klehr was out of time. the eighth circuit's ""pattern of activity"" rule contradicted the third circuit's ""last predicate act"" rule, which allows a plaintiff to recover damages accumulated since the first injury as long as the last rico violation (""last predicate act"") happened within four years of the lawsuit."

in 1979, irving independent school district agreed to provide special education for amber as required by the federal education of the handicapped act (eha). this law required texas to provide handicapped children with a free public education including ‘related services’. it only required ‘medical services’ for purposes of diagnosis or evaluation. amber’s individualized education program provided that she would attend early childhood development classes and receive physical and occupational therapy. her program, however, made no provision for school personnel to administer cic. the tatros unsuccessfully pursued administrative remedies to secure cic services during school hours.

after being arrested, doggett moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the government’s failure to prosecute him earlier violated his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.  a federal magistrate found that the length of time between indictment and arrest was presumptively prejudicial, but recommended dismissal of doggett’s motion because he did not show actual prejudice.  the district court followed the magistrate’s recommendation.  doggett then entered a conditional guilty plea, allowing him to appeal the subsequent conviction on the speedy trial claim.  the u.s. court of appeals for the 11th circuit affirmed."

1189	"manoj nijhawan was convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. he was found responsible for having caused over $600 million in damages and sentenced to 41 months imprisonment. subsequently, the board of immigration appeals (bia) determined that mr. nijhawan had committed an ""aggravated felony"" and was subject to deportation because his offense involved fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victims exceeded $10,000. on appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit, mr. nijhawan argued that 1) his offense did not involve fraud or deceit as those terms are used in the immigration and nationality act (ina) and 2) that his conviction did not establish that loss to his victims exceeded $10,000. the court of appeals affirmed the bia's findings and refuted mr. nijhawan's arguments. it held that mr. nijhawan's offenses constituted fraud or deceit as understood by the ina and that his conviction did establish that the loss to his victims exceeded $10,000, even though the jury did not determine that amount."

tharpe next petitioned the us district court for the middle district of georgia for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 u.s.c. § 2254, alleging that racial bias among the jury had rendered his conviction and sentence unable to withstand constitutional scrutiny. the district court found this claim to be procedurally defaulted, but granted him a certificate of appeal (coa) on an ineffective assistance claim. the 11th circuit then affirmed the district court’s judgment.
following the us supreme court’s 2017 decisions in pena-rodriguez v. colorado and buck v. davis, tharpe petitioned the district court under frcp 60(b)(6) to reopen his § 2254 case. he argued that pena-rodriguez should apply retroactively, allowing him to present the juror testimony that had previously been deemed inadmissible, and ultimately overcome procedural default to prevail on his claim that improper racial animus had led to his conviction and sentence. the district court denied tharpe’s motion, concluding, inter alia, that his claim was procedurally defaulted, and that he had failed to produce any clear evidence that gattie’s statements had influenced the jury’s conclusions. the 11th circuit affirmed, declining to issue a coa and stating that tharpe had failed to show that the district court’s correctness was debatable with regard to its procedural ruling."

during the negotiations, the union membership overwhelmingly rejected a consent decree between the parties that increased the total number of supervisory positions within the fire department without specifying to whom those positions would be given. the vanguards and the city moved for the approval of an amended consent decree that adopted the agreed-upon promotional system but was not subject to the union members’ approval. the district court approved the consent decree over the union’s objections. on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed. local number 93 petitioned the court for a writ of certiorari based on its argument that the consent decree was an impermissible remedy under section 706(g) of title vii. according to the union, the court was precluded from approving the new promotional system because it may benefit individuals who were not actual victims of racial discrimination.

the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit held that section 16(a)(1) did not confer jurisdiction in this case. the court recognized that the appellants were not signatories to the arbitration agreement with carlisle. thus, it reasoned there was no written agreement that could direct litigated issues into arbitration. since the appellants' motion to stay was not rooted in section 3, section 16(a)(1) did not grant appellate jurisdiction."

the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the district court's rulings on all counts but one for violation of the right to due process. the second circuit noted that the actions taken by the government occurred in the immediate aftermath of september 11th and therefore created a unique context in which iqbal's claims had to be reviewed. even with these circumstances, however, the court felt that the qualified immunity defense could protect the government only from the due process claim. the ""serious allegations of gross mistreatment"" were enough to sustain the remaining counts."

pereira was not removed and instead remained in the country. in march 2013, he was arrested for a motor vehicle violation and detained by dhs. through his attorney, pereira filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings, claiming he had never received the hearing notice with the time and place. although pereira conceded that he could be removed, he sought relief in the form of cancellation of removal under 8 u.s.c. § 1229b(b)(1), a provision that gives the attorney general discretion to cancel the removal of a non-permanent resident alien if the alien meets certain criteria, including ten years of continuous physical presence in the united states. this continuous period ends “when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a)” of the immigration and nationality act (ina). pereira contends that because he did not receive notice of the time and place of his removal hearing, his presence in the country was continuous and over ten years under the statute.
the board of immigration appeals (bia) has held that a notice to appear that does not contain the date and time of the hearing is nonetheless effective to end the period of continuous physical presence. however, pereira challenges this reading of the statute. the first circuit determined that the relevant provisions of the ina are ambiguous as to whether notice must include the date and time of the hearing to be effective, but the court found that the bia’s interpretation of the statute was reasonable and thus subject to chevron deference."

the merchant marine act of 1920 (“jones act”) created several classes of sea workers, allowing a wider breadth of causes of action for those injured within the united states’ territorial waters. it did not, however, specifically provide a cause of action for loss of consortium for spouses. similarly, the death on the high seas act of 1920 (“dohsa”) did not create a specific right to a cause of action for loss of consortium. the district court denied the claim for loss of consortium. the appellate court reversed, noting that while such motions were not available in some maritime law cases, the supreme court in sea-land servs. v. gaudet allowed a decedent’s dependents to recover for loss of society in a wrongful death maritime law claim. thus, there is no clear precedent prohibiting claims of loss of consortium from nonfatal injuries.
new york’s court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. it rejected aeli’s use of igneri v. cie. de transports oceaniques, a u.s. court of appeals second circuit decision holding that the spouse of an injured longshoreman had no cause of action for loss of consortium. it noted that most states now allowed a spouse to state a cause of action for loss of consortium. it also reasoned that the heavy burden now placed on juanita alvez as a marriage partner justified allowing her to sue for damages."

at trial, williams moved to suppress all evidence relating to the car ride conversation, arguing that the questioning violated williams’ sixth amendment right to counsel. the judge denied the motion, and a jury found williams guilty.  the iowa supreme court affirmed the conviction.  williams petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the u.s. district court for the southern district of iowa.  the court granted the writ, finding that speaking to williams during the drive violated his right to counsel, and the evidence in question was wrongly admitted at trial.  the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed."

1257	"nicholas romeo was a 33-year-old man with the mental capacity of an 18-month-old child. following the death of his father, romeo’s mother was unable to adequately care for romeo and had him involuntarily committed to pennhurst state school and hospital (“pennhurst”) on a permanent basis. during his time in the state facility, romeo suffered injuries on numerous occasions and was physically restrained at times. romeo’s mother became concerned, and after objecting to romeo’s treatment several times, sued the facility on behalf of romeo. romeo’s mother claimed that his treatment violated the protections of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the eighth amendment. specifically, romeo’s mother claimed romeo had the right to safe conditions of confinement, freedom from bodily restraints, and access to habilitation (training or treatment with the goal of eventual release).
at trial, the court instructed the jury that they could only find that pennhurst violated romeo’s constitutional rights if the officials had been “deliberately indifferent” to romeo’s medical and psychological needs, and the jury found in favor of pennhurst. on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial. the court of appeals held the eighth amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment was inapplicable, because it applies to individuals convicted of crimes, not the involuntarily committed. however, under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, romeo had liberty interests in freedom from restraint, safe conditions, and minimally adequate habilitation, which could only be violated if three distinct standards were met. an infringement of the right to safe conditions can only be justified by “substantial necessity,” the right to freedom from bodily restraints can only be infringed for “compelling necessity,” and the access to habilitation must be “acceptable in the light of present medical or other scientific knowledge."

on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed, holding that the prison officials were entitled to qualified immunity and dismissed the case. the court noted that while courts do not normally review the denial of summary judgment after a trial on the merits, a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to the general rule. the court reasoned that ms. jordan's conduct did not violate ms. ortiz's eight amendment right to humane conditions because ms. jordan was not ""deliberately indifferent"" to ms. ortiz's plight."

generally, private actors cannot violate the constitutional rights of individuals; a finding of a constitutional violation requires “state action.” however, when the government creates a private entity by special law and retains authority to appoint a majority of directors, the actions of that private entity can sometimes be regarded as governmental action. finding that the government retained authority to appoint only two of the thirteen members of mcac’s board, the district court held that mcac, its employees, and the city of new york did not create a public forum within the first amendment and dismissed the first amendment claim for lack of state action. a majority of a three-judge panel of the us court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed as to the city of new york but reversed as to mcac and its employees, relying on the supreme court’s decision in denver area educational telecommunications consortium v. fcc to find that new york city had “delegated to mnn the traditionally public function of administering and regulating speech in the public forum” of public-access cable television. thus, mnn creates a public forum and functions as a state actor."

ake intended to assert the insanity defense, so a psychiatrist had to determine ake’s mental state at the time of the killings. because ake could not afford to hire a psychiatrist, his attorney requested that the state provide him one. the court refused and rejected ake’s argument that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment required the government to provide indigent defendants with a psychiatrist to allow them to raise a meaningful insanity defense. without a psychiatrist, ake was unable to provide any evidence as to his mental state at the time of the offense. absent this evidence, jurors were instructed that ake was to be presumed sane at the time of the offense. the jury subsequently rejected ake’s insanity defense and convicted him on all counts. at the sentencing hearing, ake—still unable to afford a psychiatrist—could not provide expert testimony to mitigate his offense and was sentenced to death. ake appealed to the oklahoma criminal court of appeals, which affirmed and held that the government was not responsible for providing psychiatric help to indigent defendants charged with capital crimes."

1296	"lexmark international, inc. (lexmark) owns many patents for its printer toner cartridges. the customers who buy lexmark’s cartridges may choose a cartridge subject to a “return program,” which is a combination single-use patent and contract license, and those who purchase the return program are given a discount on the cartridge in exchange for agreeing to use the cartridge once and then return the empty cartridge to lexmark. otherwise, customers may choose  a cartridge free of restrictions on its use. some of lexmark’s cartridges sold abroad and all of the domestically-sold cartridges at issue were subject to both a discount and the return program. impression products, inc. (impression) acquired the cartridges at issue after a third party physically changed the cartridges to enable re-use in violation of the single-use return program. then, impression products acquired the cartridges abroad and resold them in the united states. 
lexmark sued impression and alleged that impression infringed on lexmark’s patents because impression products acted without authorization from lexmark to resell and reuse the cartridges. impression argued that, under the doctrine of exhaustion, impression’s resale of the cartridges is non-infringing because lexmark, in transferring the title by selling the cartridges initially, granted the requisite authority. the district court granted impression’s motion to dismiss as it related to the domestically sold cartridges and held that the patent-holder’s rights were exhausted when the initial sale was authorized and unrestricted. the motion was denied as it related to the foreign-sold cartridges, however. the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part by holding that lexmark’s sale did not “confer authority” to impression to resell without infringing on the patent. the appellate court also held that lexmark’s foreign sales did not confer authority to import, sell, or use the cartridges, and it did not waive lexmark’s rights to its patent."

on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit dismissed the case, saying that it was ""unripe"" for judicial review. the court held that the issues raised by the government only concerned the application of the department's decision regarding future importation of leu; and, therefore, the court did not have a specific factual context in which to review the claim."

the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of both claims. first, discussing the title ix claim, the court stated that five conditions must be met for a plaintiff to succeed: the student must prove that (1) the institution is a recipient of federal funding, (2) severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment occurred, (3) the harassment denied the student of educational opportunities or benefits, (4) the institution had actual knowledge of the harassment, and (5) the institution's deliberate indifference caused the student to be subjected to the harassment. the first circuit held that even if the first four factors were met in this case, the school's ""prompt"" and ""diligent"" investigation was not clearly unreasonable and therefore did not amount to deliberate indifference. rather, the school looked into each allegation quickly and thoroughly. the court also affirmed the dismissal of the fitzgeralds' section 1983 claim, applying the so-called ""remedial"" exception prohibiting such claims when the allegedly violated federal law is itself specific enough to demonstrate congress' intention to allow only those remedies referred to in the statute itself. according to the first circuit, title ix is one of these remedial statutes and therefore any alleged violations of the statute cannot be litigated under section 1983."

david patchak, a resident of wayland township, filed suit against ken salazar, the secretary of the department of the interior on august 1, 2008, taking advantage of a stay of the secretary's action granted due to a separate suit against the secretary by a michigan anti-gambling organization. patchak alleged that the band's gaming facility would destroy the peace and quiet of his community, create pollution, and increase crime. the band intervened as a defendant. at trial, the secretary argued that the quiet title act (""qta"") precluded any person from seeking to divest the united states of title to indian land trusts; hence, because the bradley tract was in trust while patchak's suit was pending, the district court did not have jurisdiction. the court, however, dismissed patchak's suit on the ground that he lacked standing to challenge palazar's authority under the ira, holding that patchak's interests do not fall within the ira's zone-of-interests.
on appeal, the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed, holding that patchak fulfilled the zone-of-interests test for standing. the court held that patchak did not have to demonstrate that the statute was meant to benefit individuals in his situation, pointing to portions of the ira tasking the secretary with considering ""affected members of the public"" before using his trust authority. the court also rejected the secretary's argument that the qta barred patchak's suit, reasoning that congress intended the qta to limit actions in which the plaintiff claims an interest in property contrary to the government's interest. in contrast, patchak did not seek sole possession of title to the bradley track. therefore, the court held that his suit fell within the general waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in the administrative procedure act."

1360	"in august 2009, the texas division of the sons of confederate veterans (texas scv), a non-profit organization that works to preserve the memory and reputation of soldiers who fought for the confederacy in the civil war, applied to have a new specialty license plate issued by the texas department of motor vehicles (tdmv). the proposed license plate had two confederate flags on it: one in the organization's logo, and one faintly making up the background of the plate. the tdmv had a policy stating that it ""may refuse to create a new specialty license plate if the design might be offensive to any member of the public."" the board in charge of approving new specialty plates received multiple negative comments from the public regarding this plate and ultimately voted to deny texas scv's application.
texas scv sued in federal district court claiming their first and fourteenth amendment rights were violated. the tdmv argued that the free speech clause did not apply in this case because license plates are a form of government speech; therefore, they were within their rights to choose which messages and views they wanted to express on the plates. the district court disagreed and held that the plates were private, non-governmental speech, and that the tdmv's denial was a reasonable, content-based restriction of speech in a non-public forum. the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed and held that tdmv's denial was a form of viewpoint discrimination that ""discriminated against texas scv's view that the confederate flag is a symbol of sacrifice, independence, and southern heritage."""

1361	"from 1993 through 2000, the united states army corps of engineers imposed a temporary flood regime around the dave donaldson black river wildlife management area. the flood regime caused flooding across the region encompassed by the wildlife management area, which restricted access to and destroyed or degraded thousands of timber trees.
the petitioners brought a case in federal court in an attempt to recover under the takings clause of the fifth amendment for the loss of their property resulting from the united state's flood regime. the federal court held that the flood regime constituted a fifth amendment taking and that the united states owed petitioners approximately $5.6 million as just compensation.
the government appealed, and the appellate court reversed the lower court's judgment. the appellate court reasoned that the flood regime was a temporary government action, and that only a permanent flooding condition would constitute a taking under the fifth amendment. the petitioners appealed the appellate court's decision."

the municipal league appealed, and an eighth circuit court of appeals panel reversed the decision. the panel held the words ""any entity"" were intentionally broad and that a proper understanding of them would include municipal governments. the state could therefore not regulate attempts by municipalities to provide telecommunications services. the fcc, along with the state of missouri and southwestern bell telephone company, appealed the decision to the supreme court."

hoeper sued air wisconsin in a colorado state court and alleged defamation under virginia law. air wisconsin moved for a directed verdict based on the argument that it was immune from civil liability under atsa. air wisconsin also argued that hoeper could not prove ""actual malice"" because its statements were ""substantially true"" and therefore protected by the free speech clause of the first amendment. the trial court denied the motion to dismiss. the jury found that air wisconsin's statements to the tsa were false and that it made at least one statement with reckless disregard for the truth, so the jury awarded hoeper damages. a colorado appellate court affirmed the verdict. the colorado supreme court held that the trial court's submission of the matter to the jury was improper; however, the error was harmless in this case because air wisconsin was not entitled to claim immunity under atsa. the colorado supreme court further held that substantial evidence supported the jury's finding that the statements were false."

1404	"the armed career criminal act (acca) provides in relevant part that a person who has three previous convictions for a “violent felony” or a “serious drug offense” shall serve a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison. in recent cases, the u.s. supreme court has adopted a “categorical” approach to determine whether a prior conviction constitutes a “violent felony” within the acca. under this approach, the sentencing court must look only to the statutory definition of the prior offense and not to the particular facts underlying the prior convictions. at issue in this case is whether the categorical approach applies to the determination of whether a prior conviction constitutes a “serious drug offense” as well.
eddie lee shular qualified as an armed career criminal on the basis of six prior florida convictions for controlled substance offenses—five for sale of cocaine and one for possession with intent to sell. none of these offenses required that the government prove that shular had “knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance,” that is, that the substance possessed or sold was cocaine. under the categorical approach, none of shular’s florida convictions would qualify as a “serious drug offense” because the florida crimes are broader than the generic drug analogues under federal law. the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit rejected the categorical approach to serious drug offenses, holding that the plain language of the acca definition “requires only that the predicate offense involve certain activities related to controlled substances.”"	False

the defendant commonwealth of virginia did not appeal; instead, ten members of congress, who had intervened in the case at the trial level, appealed to the u.s. supreme court, which remanded the case for reconsideration in light of its decision in alabama legislative black caucus v. alabama. in that case, the court held that the voting rights act does not require a legislature to maintain a particular minority number percentage in creating a districting plan, but rather it requires that the legislature maintain a minority’s ability to elect a candidate of choice. in considering whether a districting plan is unconstitutional, courts must examine whether racial considerations predominated over nonracial ones in determining which voters to place in which district. on remand, the district court again determined that the third congressional district was unconstitutional because racial considerations predominated in creating the plan."

the texas court of criminal appeals rejected each of medellin's arguments and dismissed his petition. the court interpreted sanchez-llamas as standing for the principle that rulings of the icj are not binding on state courts. the texas court stood by its position that allowing medellin to raise the vienna convention issue after his trial would violate state procedural rules, and that those rules were not supplanted by the convention. the president had no authority to order the enforcement in state court of an icj ruling, because that would imply a law-making power not allocated to him by the constitution."

from february to september 2006, cochise provided security services under the subcontract. each month, the us government paid cochise at least $1 million more than it would have paid armorgroup had armorgroup been awarded the subcontract, plus other expenses related to cochise not being adequately equipped to perform the services required. in 2006, shaw, who had orchestrated the fraudulent award of the subcontract to cochise, rotated out of iraq, and parsons immediately reopened the subcontract for bidding and awarded it to armorgroup.
several years later, in 2010, fbi agents interviewed parsons employee billy joe hunt about his role in a separate kickback scheme, and during that interview hunt informed the agents about the contractors’ fraudulent scheme involving the subcontract for security services. hunt was charged with federal crimes related to the kickback scheme and served ten months in federal prison.
after he was released, in 2013, hunt filed a qui tam action under seal alleging that parsons and cochise had violated the false claims act (fca), 31 u.s.c. §§ 3729–33, by submitting to the united states false or fraudulent claims for payment. the united states declined to intervene in the action, and hunt’s complaint was unsealed. the contractors moved to dismiss, arguing that hunt’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations in 31 u.s.c. § 3731(b)(1), which requires a civil action alleging an fca violation to be brought within the later of (1) “6 years after the date on which the violation ... is committed” or (2) “3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the united states charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances....” the district court granted the contractors’ motion to dismiss, finding that under either provision, hunt’s claim would be time-barred. reviewing the district court’s dismissal de novo, the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed and remanded. the eleventh circuit held that when hunt (the relator) learned of the fraud is immaterial for statute of limitation purposes, and thus the period began to run when government officials learned of the facts giving rise to the claim."

lorenzo jones sustained serious injuries in a car accident while in custody. he sued prison officials in federal court, claiming that they were violating his eighth amendment rights by making him do arduous work despite his injuries. the officials moved to dismiss the suit, because jones had not provided any evidence or description of the administrative remedies he claimed to have pursued. the district court granted the motion and dismissed the suit.
on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed. the circuit court ruled that in order for jones to sue, he would have had to provide the court with copies of his grievance forms or at least describe the administrative processes he had exhausted. the circuit court further ruled that the plra requires ""total exhaustion,"" which means that if a prisoner's suit has multiple claims, administrative remedies must have been exhausted for each and every claim.

the district court dismissed the suit, because williams had neglected to name any prison officials as defendants in his medical complaint. therefore, the court ruled, the administrative remedies for that claim could not be considered to have been exhausted.
on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed, ruling that ""the prisoner must demonstrate that he has exhausted the administrative remedies with respect to each individual he intends to sue."" the circuit court also ruled that the plra requires ""total exhaustion,"" which meant that williams's entire suit was dismissed because of his unexhausted medical claim, even though the administrative remedies for his request for a new cell had been exhausted."

as part of its challenge, the challengers sought—and the us district court for the southern district of new york, the venue for their action, authorized—depositions of high-ranking executive branch officials to determine secretary ross’s subjective motivations in making the decision at issue.

the government filed a petition for mandamus asking the court to direct the trial court to exclude fact-finding beyond the official records, or, in the alternative, review the appellate court decision itself. treating the petition for mandamus as a petition for certiorari, the court granted the petition to review the decision of the court below.

after the supreme court decided, in atkins v. virginia, 536 u.s. 304, that executing the mentally retarded violated the eighth amendment, the fifth circuit reconsidered its holding. it affirmed the decision on the grounds that execution was only unconstitutional if the defendant could show that his mental retardation had actually caused the crime; being mentally retarded in and of itself did not exempt someone from the death penalty."

1475	"in 1943, peter meyer took out life insurance policies in his own name worth $50,000. he pledged his insurance policies to huntington national bank of columbus, ohio as collateral security for a loan. this gave the bank the right to satisfy its claim out of the 'net proceeds of the policy when it becomes a claim by death.' after peter meyer pledged the policies to the bank, the united states determined that he owed $6,159.09 plus interest in unpaid taxes. the united states filed notice of tax lien on july 11, 1955.
peter meyer died on december 28, 1955, owing $26,844.66 to huntington national bank. ethel meyer, the petitioner and peter meyer's widow, was named executrix of his estate and received $441.21, representing the remainder of the full cash surrender from peter meyer's insurance policies after payment to the bank.
the united states brought suit against ethel meyer under 26 u.s.c.a. 6321 and 6322, arguing that it should be compensated for the full tax lien by marshalling the funds already paid to huntington national bank. at trial, ethel meyer argued that she owed nothing to the government because she was not personally liable for peter meyer's tax lien. she also argued that the tax lien did not and could not attach to the net proceeds of the cash surrender because those proceeds would be exempt under new york insurance law.
district court judge edmund palmieri held that the government was entitled to recover the full tax lien through the insurance policy's full cash surrender. the court relied on united states v. behrens, where the court ordered a defendant to pay both a bank lien and tax lien from the same cash surrender. although most of peter meyer's cash surrender was pledged to the bank for the payment of loans, this did not preclude the government from collecting on its full tax lien first. the u.s. court of appeals, second circuit, affirmed in a per curiam ruling. the court agreed that behrens controlled the case."

a grand jury indicted heien for two counts of trafficking cocaine. heien filed a motion to suppress the evidence discovered during the search of his vehicle, and the trial court denied the motion. the north carolina court of appeals reversed the trial court and held that the traffic stop was not objectively reasonable because north carolina law only required one working brake light. the north carolina supreme court reversed and held that when an officer's mistake of the law is reasonable, it may give rise to the ""reasonable suspicion"" required for a traffic stop of a vehicle under the fourth amendment. that north carolina supreme court sent the case back to the state court of appeals.
the north carolina court of appeals found no error in the trial court's judgment. a dissenting judge, however, stated that the north carolina supreme court's ruling created ""fundamental unfairness"" because it held citizens to the traditional rule that ""ignorance of the law is no excuse"" while allowing police to be ignorant of the law. based on this dissent, heien again appealed to the north carolina supreme court which rejected heien's appeal."

1501	"on november 14, 1978, a texas jury in bell county found thomas a. barefoot guilty of the murder of a police officer. a separate sentencing hearing was held before the same jury to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed. the prosecution called two psychiatrists to the stand who testified that barefoot was likely to commit further acts of violence and would remain a danger to society. the jury sentenced barefoot to death. barefoot appealed to the texas court of criminal appeals and argued that the use of the psychiatrists to testify as to future conduct was unconstitutional because psychiatric testimony cannot accurately predict future dangerousness and is likely to produce erroneous convictions. he also argued that this specific testimony was unconstitutional, as neither psychiatrist had personally examined barefoot. the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.
barefoot’s execution was scheduled for september 7, 1980. a stay of execution was granted by the supreme court pending the filing and disposition of a petition of certiorari. the petition was denied, and barefoot’s execution was rescheduled for october 1981. the texas court of criminal appeals denied barefoot’s application for habeas corpus, and he filed a petition for habeas corpus in district court. the district court granted a stay of execution pending action on the petition, and later denied the petition and vacated the stay of execution. the district court also issued a certificate of probable cause that would allow barefoot to continue the appeals process. the texas court of criminal appeals again denied barefoot’s petition for habeas corpus and motion for a stay of execution. barefoot appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth district for a stay of execution, pending the consideration of his appeal of the denial of his petition for habeas corpus, and the court of appeals denied the motion."

several years after the accident, ahlborn received $550,000 in a settlement with the parties liable for her injuries. the sum covered her medical treatment as well as pain and suffering, lost earnings, and her lost earning potential in the future. only $35,581 of the settlement was earmarked for her medical treatment, however. when the adhs demanded that she repay the full $215,645, therefore, ahlborn refused, and the issue went to a federal district court in arkansas. the judge sided with the adhs, ruling that it was not unreasonable for arkansas to require ahlborn to agree to repay them fully from any settlement she might receive in order to be eligible, even if the portion specifically allocated for medical treatment was less than the amount demanded by medicaid.
an 8th circuit court of appeals panel reversed, however, finding that seizing money from her settlement that had not been earmarked for medical treatment would violate federal medicaid regulations, which forbid state governments from seizing the property of medicaid recipients in order to recover money spent on treatment. the panel therefore ordered that ahlborn repay just $35,581 to the adhs."

in 1975, congress enacted the indian self-determination and education assistance act (isda) to “help indian tribes assume responsibility for aid programs that benefit their members.” isda defines an “indian tribe” as “any indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any alaska native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the alaska native claims settlement act (85 stat. 688), which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the united states to indians because of their status as indians.”

the personal representative of gullett’s estate sued ford motor co. in montana state court, alleging design-defect, failure-to-warn, and negligence claims. ford moved to dismiss the claims for lack of personal jurisdiction.
for a state court to have personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the due process clause requires that the court have either general personal jurisdiction or specific personal jurisdiction. a court has general personal jurisdiction over a corporate defendant if the defendant’s headquarters are within the state or if it is incorporated in the state. a court has specific personal jurisdiction over a corporate defendant if the plaintiff’s claims “arise out of or relate to” the defendant’s activities within the state.
ford motor co. has its headquarters in michigan and is incorporated in delaware. ford assembled the vehicle in kentucky and first sold it to a dealership in washington state. the dealership then sold it to an oregon resident, who later sold the vehicle to a purchaser who brought it to montana.
the district court denied ford’s motion to dismiss, finding a “connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.” the montana supreme court affirmed, reasoning that by advertising and selling parts within the state of montana, ford had availed itself of the privilege of doing business in that state and was therefore subject to specific jurisdiction there.

1536	after resigning as a lifeguard, beth ann faragher brought an action against the city of boca raton and her immediate supervisors, alleging that the supervisors had created a sexually hostile atmosphere by touching, remarking, and commenting. faragher asserted that this conduct constituted discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964. the district court concluded that faragher's supervisors' conduct was sufficiently serious to alter the conditions of her employment and constitute an abusive working environment. the court then held that the city could be held liable. in reversing, the en banc court of appeals held that faragher's supervisors were not acting within the scope of their employment when they engaged in the harassing conduct, that knowledge of the harassment could not be imputed to the city, and that the city could not be held liable for negligence in failing to prevent it.

the petitioners are religious organizations that argue that the contraceptive coverage mandate of the aca violates the religious freedom restoration act (rfra), which congress enacted in 1993, because the mandate requires these organizations to “facilitate” the provision of insurance coverage for contraceptive services that they oppose on religious grounds. in several separate cases, the relevant district courts issued injunctions against the government, and the relevant courts of appeals reversed. the appellate courts held that the religious organizations were unable to show that the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened the exercise of their religious freedom."

the ohio revised code contains a provision that unpaid debts owed to a state entity get “certified” to the ohio attorney general, who is then responsible for collecting the debt or disposing of it by other means. the attorney general may enlist “special counsel” to collect debts on the attorney general’s behalf. to do so, the special counsel and the attorney general enter into a retention agreement that, among other terms, allows the special counsel to use the attorney general’s letterhead in connection with claims arising out of the tax debts the special counsel is authorized to collect.
the plaintiffs in this case are individuals who received debt collection letters that used the seal of the ohio attorney general from the defendants, who became special counsel to the attorney general in 2013. the plaintiffs sued and argued that the defendants violated the fdcpa by using the ohio attorney general letterhead. the district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment and held that special counsel are not “debt collectors” under the meaning of the fdcpa because they are officers of the state for the purposes of debt collection, and therefore the use of the ohio attorney general letterhead was not false or misleading. the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit vacated the lower court’s decision and held that special counsel are “debt collectors” under the meaning of the fdcpa and do not fall under the exemption, and that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the use of ohio attorney general’s seal on debt collection letters was misleading."

after exhausting his appellate options at the state level, turner filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court. because the facts of the case ""did not suggest a significant likelihood that racial prejudice might [have] infect[ed the defendant's] trial,"" the district court held that the trial judge's refusal to question potential jurors about racial prejudice was not unconstitutional. the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed."

1607	"in 1956, the attorney general of alabama, john m. patterson, filed suit against the naacp, a new york corporation advocating for equal rights for black americans. he filed the action as an attempt to oust the association from the state. the claim alleged that the naacp failed to comply with alabama statutes requiring foreign corporations to register with the alabama secretary of state, along with other acts more clearly related to the naacp’s political mission. that same day, the attorney general obtained a restraining order barring the naacp from conducting business in the state or attempting to comply with the statutory requirements in question. before the case was heard on the merits, the court found the naacp to be in contempt, in part for failing to comply with a court order requiring the naacp to produce records.
the supreme court of alabama dismissed the naacp’s petition for a writ of certiorari. on appeal, the supreme court of the united states held that requiring the naacp to produce records including names and addresses of its members was a violation of those members’ freedom of association. the supreme court of alabama, however, again affirmed the judgment of contempt, arguing that the supreme court’s judgment rested on the mistaken premise that alabama had incorrectly interpreted its own procedural rules. the supreme court of the united states again remanded the case in a per curiam opinion, holding that the naacp had satisfied the district court’s order even though the naacp did not produce the membership lists.
the naacp then filed an action in federal court, alleging that the alabama courts were depriving the organization of its constitutional rights and seeking to enjoin enforcement of the trial court’s restraining order. the district court dismissed the action, but the united states court of appeals, fifth circuit vacated the judgment and remanded to the district court, instructing the district court to retain jurisdiction only if alabama state courts did not promptly try the naacp’s case. the supreme court of the united states then ordered the district court to try the naacp’s case unless the state of alabama gave the naacp a hearing before january 2, 1962. in december 1961, an alabama circuit court decreed that the naacp continued its activities in alabama in violation of the laws and constitution of alabama. the supreme court of alabama affirmed."

1638	"in december 1938, thomas leiter conveyed approximately 8,711 acres of land in plaquemines parish, louisiana to the united states. the deed contained a mineral reservation under which leiter retained the right to mine and remove all valuable minerals until april 1, 1945. the deed allowed for the extension of this reservation for an additional five years so long as operations were conducted profitably during the previous five years for an average of fifty days a year. if at the end of the original term or an additional extended term the operation had not carried on for fifty days a year, leiter’s right to mine would terminate, and complete title would become vested in the united states. no mineral operations were conducted on the land in question during the original term.
on march 1, 1949, the united states conveyed the operating rights under lease to frank j. and albert lobrano, who then conveyed those rights to the california company. the california company drilled and completed eighty wells, producing $3,500,000 in royalties for the united states. leiter minerals, inc. then filed an action in state court against allen l. lobrano and the california company based on a louisiana law allegedly making a reservation of mineral rights to the united states “imprescriptible”. the united states was not a party to the suit. leiter minerals claimed that it was the fee simple owner of all the oil, gas and mineral rights in or on the land acquired by the united states from thomas leiter.
the united states then brought an action in district court; it sought to quiet leiter minerals’ title and rights and to enjoin leiter minerals from further asserting any claims in state court. the united states argued in part that irreparable injury in the form of lost royalties would result from any dispossession to its lessees. the district court granted the injunction, holding that the action could only be tried in federal court because the united states was not a party to the state court action."

abby gail lassiter, william’s mother, was convicted of second-degree murder in july of 1976, and began serving her twenty-five to forty year sentence at the north carolina correctional center for women. in 1978, the department petitioned the court to terminate abby’s parental rights. it alleged that abby had not contacted william since december 1975, and that she willfully left william in foster care. on august 31, 1978, the state brought abby from prison to the hearing, which opened with a discussion of whether abby should have more time to find legal assistance. the court concluded that she had ample opportunity to obtain counsel; abby did not claim to be indigent, and the court did not appoint counsel for her.
a social worker from the department testified about abby’s lack of contact with william, abby’s mother’s unfitness to care for william, and william’s condition. abby cross-examined the social worker, but many of her questions were disallowed because they were arguments. she also testified on her own behalf and later cross-examined her mother, who denied saying she could not care for william, contradicting the department’s allegation. the court held that abby willfully failed to maintain concern or responsibility for william’s welfare, and terminated abby’s status as william’s parent. on appeal, the north carolina court of appeals determined that north carolina was not constitutionally mandated to provide abby counsel during the hearing. the supreme court of north carolina denied her application for discretionary review."

during the jury selection process, the potential jurors were questioned individually. after the judge denied the prosecutor’s for-cause motions, the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to remove eight panel members who expressed any degree of uncertainty in their ability to cast a vote in a case potentially involving the death penalty. the voir dire oath of panelist h.c. bounds was confused, but she ultimately stated that she was capable of voting to impose the death penalty. the judge eventually excused bounds for cause, however, implying that he had improperly denied the prosecutor the use of for-cause motions for the other panelists.
the jury convicted gray of capital murder and sentenced him to death. on appeal, the supreme court of mississippi divided on whether gray’s death sentence was invalid because the exclusion of bounds violated gray’s right to a fair and impartial jury. it ultimately affirmed gray’s sentence despite the violation of mississippi state procedure created by the trial court’s failure to follow voir dire guidelines in its dismissal of bounds."

the district court decided that the tribal court had jurisdiction over the claim, and the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed. in seeking supreme court review, plains commerce argued that the tribal court should not have had jurisdiction, and the eighth circuit erred in deciding so, because the claim did not fit into one of the exceptions granting such jurisdiction set forth by the supreme court in _montana v. u.s. _ on the other hand, the longs argued that federal courts whose geographic reach encompasses tribal lands have repeatedly allowed tribal courts to adjudicate civil suits against non-members who voluntarily did business with members."

shortly after entering the agreement, the federal trade commission (""ftc"") filed a complaint against the pharmaceutical companies. the ftc claimed that solvay was unlikely to win the patent infringement suit; therefore the settlement unfairly protected an invalid patent monopoly. by limiting competition in the androgel market, the manufacturers were restraining trade in violation of antitrust laws. the manufacturers argued that the ftc failed to state a valid claim because the agreement merely protected solvay's already existing patent rights. the united states district court for the northern district of georgia agreed with the manufacturers and dismissed the case. the ftc appealed to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit, which affirmed the lower court's decision. the appellate court explained that the manufacturers' reverse payment settlement is lawful as long as it restrains competition in the same way that patent protection typically restrains competition."

 in certain circumstances, government officials are protected from civil suits for actions done in the scope of their official duties though absolute or qualified privilege. the district court ruled in favor of matteo and madigan, rejecting barr’s claim that his statements were protected by privilege.  the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed, considering only absolute privilege.  the u.s. supreme court vacated and remanded so the court of appeals could consider qualified privilege.  on remand, the court of appeals held that qualified privilege existed, but was defeated due to barr’s malice.  the court remanded the case to district court for a new trial."

1710	when the colorado legislature failed to pass a redistricting plan in 2000, the state courts created one at the request of a group of voters. the legislature succeeded in passing a redistricting plan in 2003. the state attorney general brought suit in the colorado state supreme court to require the secretary of state to use the court-ordered plan, and the colorado general assembly defended its own plan. the colorado supreme court ruled that the legislature's plan violated article v of the state constitution. a group of citizens including keith lance brought another suit in federal court alleging that article v of the colorado constitution, as interpreted by the colorado supreme court, violated the elections clause of the u.s. constitution. under the supreme court's rooker-feldman doctrine, no federal court except the supreme court may hear appeals from state courts. the district court held that since lance was in privity with the general assembly - that is, their claims were similar enough to constitute a mutual interest - lance's suit was in effect an appeal of the general assembly's loss in state court. therefore, the district court ruled that it had no jurisdiction under the rooker-feldman doctrine and declined to hear the case.

1712	"when manuel flores-montano approached the u.s.-mexico border, u.s. customs inspectors noticed his hand shaking; an inspector tapped flores-montano's gas tank with a screwdriver and noticed that the tank sounded solid; a drug-sniffing dog alerted to the vehicle. after a mechanic began disassembling the car's fuel tank, inspectors found 37 kilograms of marijuana bricks in the tank.
flores-montano was charged in federal district court in california for importing and possessing marijuana with intent to distribute. flores-montano moved to suppress the marijuana finding on fourth amendment grounds. he argued that the search that yielded the marijuana finding was intrusive and non-routine and therefore required reasonable suspicion (which, he argued, was not present in his case).
relying on u.s. v. molina-tarazon, a case decided by the u.s. ninth circuit court of appeals in 2002 (with similar circumstances), the district court agreed that the search was non-routine and thus required reasonable suspicion. the government, the court held, failed to prove that reasonable suspicion prompted its search. the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed."

sabri was charged in federal court with bribery. he moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the section of united states code that he was charged under was unconstitutional. he claimed that congress could only regulate the dispersal of federal funds; because the statute did not require the prosecutors to show that the bribery had affected any federal funds, only that it had affected an organization that received federal funds, he argued that it was outside of congress's power to legislate. the district court sided with sabri and dismissed the charges.
on appeal, an eighth circuit court of appeals panel reversed. it found that, because federal funds were often mixed with other funds by organizations that distributed them, it would be difficult for prosecutors to prove that the funds affected by an attempted bribe were federal funds. as a result, the government would have to regulate all bribes to organizations that dispersed federal funds in order to meaningfully protect federal funds. because congress had authority under the necessary and proper clause and the spending clause (both found in article i, section 8 of the constitution) to ensure that government funds were not misspent, the bribery statute was therefore constitutional."

on remand, the petitioners filed a motion to dismiss the complaints by arguing that the seniority system was exempt from the civil rights act. the district court denied the motion. the court of appeals affirmed the decision because that the lines of progression are not a seniority system. the court of appeals also held that the immunity for seniority systems only extends to those in place before the effective date of the civil rights act."

the voting rights act of 1965 was enacted as a response to the nearly century-long history of voting discrimination. section 5 prohibits eligible districts from enacting changes to their election laws and procedures without gaining official authorization. section 4(b) defines the eligible districts as ones that had a voting test in place as of november 1, 1964 and less than 50% turnout for the 1964 presidential election. such districts must prove to the attorney general or a three-judge panel of a washington, d.c. district court that the change ""neither has the purpose nor will have the effect"" of negatively impacting any individual's right to vote based on race or minority status. section 5 was originally enacted for five years, but has been continually renewed since that time.
shelby county, alabama, filed suit in district court and sought both a declaratory judgment that section 5 and section 4(b) are unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against their enforcement. the district court upheld the constitutionality of the sections and granted summary judgment for the attorney general. the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that congress did not exceed its powers by reauthorizing section 5 and that section 4(b) is still relevant to the issue of voting discrimination."

david harris and christine bowser are u.s. citizens registered to vote in the two districts at issue. they sued and argued that north carolina used the voting rights act’s requirements as a pretext to place more black voters in those two districts to reduce black voters’ influence in other districts. the district court determined that race was the predominant factor motivating the redistricting plan and therefore that the redistricting plan was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander that violated the equal protection clause."

1743	herbert goldblatt owned 38 acres of land within the town of hempstead (town) and often used the land for his business of mining sand and gravel. during excavation, water filled the crater, which widened and deepened. the town expanded around the excavation and later enacted a series of ordinances to regulate mining excavation within its limits. in 1958, the town amended an ordinance to prohibit excavation below the water table and impose a duty refill any excavation currently below the level. in 1959, the town sued goldblatt for not complying with the ordinance. goldblatt argued the ordinance is unconstitutional because it was not regulatory but rather represented the town confiscating his property without compensation. the court of appeals of new york held for the town of hempstead, allowing them to enforce the prohibition and the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the decision.

1765	"on january 29, 1994, around 1:00 a.m., nine-year-old jane doe was raped in the bedroom of her trailer in carlin, nevada. troy brown and his brother travis lived in the same trailer park as jane doe. their brother trent and his wife lived in a trailer across the street from jane doe's trailer. both troy and trent were acquainted with jane doe's family, but jane did not know travis.
that night, troy drank at least ten shots of vodka followed by beer chasers; he was so drunk that he vomited on himself after leaving a bar at 12:15 a.m. two witnesses saw a man stumbling between the browns' trailer and that of jane doe's family around 1:00 a.m. jane doe called her mother to report the rape at approximately 1:00 a.m.; according to troy, he returned to his trailer from the bar at approximately 1:30 a.m, theoretically giving him enough time to assault jane doe.
troy brown was arrested and charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child, attempted murder, and abuse and neglect of a child resulting in substantial mental harm.
there was a large amount of conflicting evidence drawn from jane doe's testimony and from the crime scene itself. most relevantly, the state's expert tested semen taken from jane doe's underwear. she determined that the dna matched troy's and testified that the probability it belonged to another person from the general population was 1 in 3,000,000. troy brown's family tested the semen independently and found a random match probability of 1 in 10,000, but this was not introduced into evidence at trial. the jury found troy brown guilty of sexual assault and abuse and neglect of a child and sentenced him to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 10 years.
on appeal, brown argued that double jeopardy barred the duplication of sexual assault charges, that the dna evidence was improperly admitted, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. the nevada supreme court vacated the charge for abuse and neglect and remanded to the trial court for sentencing. the trial court again sentenced brown to life in prison. his petition for post-conviction relief was denied.
on appeal to the district court, brown claimed that the state's evidence was legally insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, using the habeas corpus review developed by the court in jackson v. virginia. brown submitted a report prepared by laurence mueller, a professor in ecology and evolutionary biology (""mueller report""). the mueller report suggested that the prosecution's random match probability gave an improper impression that the likelihood of troy brown's innocence was also 1 in 3,000,000. it also questioned the state expert's testimony on the probability that one of troy brown's brothers would match the dna sample, arguing that the likelihood of a match to one of troy's brothers was as high as 1 in 66. the district court supplemented the record with the mueller report, as it was not presented to any state court.
the district court then set aside the state's dna testimony as unreliable and held that no rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. the u.s. court of appeals, ninth circuit, affirmed the district court's ruling in a divided decision. it held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by supplementing the record with the mueller report and that the admission of the state's dna evidence was a due process violation and a violation of federal law."

when employees exercise their stock options when the market price exceeds the price at which the employee has a right to buy the stock, the employee can benefit from a windfall. the internal revenue service argues that this windfall is taxable, just as employees’ wages are taxable. 
the district court found for the government, and the ninth circuit affirmed. the appeals court reasoned that while the government’s argument that “anything that has a market value is a form of money remuneration” was too broad, it was still correct in its assertion that stock is equivalent to cash. moreover, as a policy concern, the government’s position avoids creating a tax incentive that could distort the ways in which employers structure compensation packages."

at trial, icp attempted to show discrimination by disparate impact, and the district court found that the statistical allocation of tax credits constituted a prima facie case for disparate impact. using a standard for disparate impact claims that the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit articulated in town of huntington v. huntington branch , the court then shifted the burden to tdhca to show the allocation of tax credits was based on a compelling governmental interest and no less discriminatory alternatives existed. tdhca was unable to show no less discriminatory alternatives existed, so the district court found in favor of icp. tdhca appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit and claimed that the district court used the wrong standard to evaluate disparate impact claims. the appellate court affirmed and held that the district court's standard mirrored the standard promulgated by the department of housing and urban development, the agency tasked with implementing the fair housing act."

carrier then filed a similar appeal in federal district court, again citing the 14th amendment due process claims. the state argued that the appeal was procedural barred because it dealt with issues not raised during the initial appeal. carrier countered that the omission of the claim had been his attorney's mistake (rather than a tactical decision), and that it should therefore not be held against him. the federal district court rejected the argument, dismissing the case. a divided fourth circuit court of appeals panel reversed the decision, finding that the omission had been the attorney's mistake and therefore represented a failure of the attorney to provide effective counsel in that particular part of the case (though the representation as a whole was not unconstitutionally poor). the panel stated that because the omission resulted from ineffective counsel, it should not be held against carrier."

two of the female pharmacists who were denied advancement filed equal employment opportunity (eeo) complaints, and babb provided statements and testified in support of their eeo claims. the pharmacists claimed that their non-selection purportedly for lack of advanced scopes was pretext for discrimination and that any justification for denying advanced scopes was pretext for discrimination as well.
babb alleged that as a result of her participation in the eeo process, she was denied opportunities to participate in the new program and that pharmacy management required her to agree to a schedule that was unworkable for her department. unable to meet this requirement, babb’s advanced scope was removed and was consequently disqualified from promotion. a female pharmacist under 30 without an advanced scope was selected for the promotion.
babb brought this action under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 (adea) alleging that she was the victim of gender-plus-age discrimination and that the va retaliated against her for participating in protected eeo in violation of those laws. the district court granted summary judgment for the va. on appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit, babb argued that the district court erred in part by not allowing her to prove that illegal discrimination or retaliation was a “motivating factor” behind the va’s refusal to promote her. the eleventh circuit affirmed the lower court, finding itself bound by precedent that federal sector employees’ claims under adea and title vii require that the plaintiff show discrimination or retaliation is a “but for” factor in the adverse personnel action."

a district court affirmed, finding that crown failed to consider its employees' interest. crown appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit, claiming that it did not consider the pace plan because section 4041 of erisa prevents termination by way of a merger into a multiemployer plan. the ninth circuit affirmed the district court, ruling that erisa does allow termination by way of a merger into a multiemployer plan."

1816	john papai was injured while painting the housing structure of the tug pt. barrow. the pt. barrow is operated by harbor tug &amp; barge co., which hired papai to do the work, which involved no sailing with the vessel. papai had been employed by harbor tug on twelve previous occasions in the two months before his injury, receiving those jobs through the inland boatman's union hiring hall, which had provided papai with short term jobs with various vessels for about two years. most of papai's jobs were deckhand work, which papai said involved manning the lines on and off board vessels while they dock or undock. papai sued harbor tug, claiming negligence under the jones act, which serves to protect seamen or workers who face regular exposure to the perils of the sea. the district court granted harbor tug summary judgment upon finding that papai did not enjoy seaman status under the jones act. the court of appeals reversed and remanded for a trial papai's seaman status and his corresponding jones act claim. the court concluded that the relevant inquiry was not whether papai had a permanent connection with the vessel, but whether his relationship with a vessel or an identifiable group of vessels was substantial in duration and nature, and found that this required consideration of his employment's total circumstances. moreover, the court determined that a reasonable jury could conclude that papai satisfied this test, for if the type of work a maritime worker customarily performs would entitle him to seaman status if performed for a single employer, he should not be deprived of that status simply because the industry operates under a daily assignment, rather than a permanent employment system.

lange moved to suppress the evidence obtained in the garage. at the suppression hearing, the prosecutor argued that lange committed a misdemeanor when he failed to stop after the officer activated his overhead lights and that the officer had probable cause to arrest lange for this misdemeanor offense. based on this probable cause, the prosecutor argued that exigent circumstances justified the officer’s warrantless entry into lange’s garage. lange’s attorney argued that a reasonable person in lange's position would not have thought he was being detained when the officer activated his overhead lights, and the officer should not have entered lange's garage without a warrant. the court denied lange’s motion to suppress, and the appellate division affirmed. lange pled no contest and then appealed the denial of his suppression motion a second time. the appellate division affirmed lange's judgment of conviction.
in the meantime, lange filed a civil suit, asking the court to overturn the suspension of his license, and the civil court granted the petition after determining lange's arrest was unlawful. the court reasoned that the “hot pursuit” doctrine did not justify the warrantless entry because when the officer entered lange's garage, all the officer knew was that lange had been playing his music too loudly and had honked his horn unnecessarily, which are infractions, not felonies.

on march 27, 2017, petitioner cic services, an advisor to taxpayers engaging in micro-captive transactions, sued the irs and the treasury department in federal court, alleging that the irs promulgated notice 2016-66 in violation of the administrative procedure act (“apa”). the petitioner asked the court to stop the irs from enforcing the notice. the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, and the federal defendants raised the defense that the lawsuit was barred by the anti-injunction act, 26 u.s.c. § 7421(a) and the tax exception to the declaratory judgment act, 28 u.s.c. § 2201, which divest federal district courts of jurisdiction over suits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.” the district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed the dismissal."

1846	randolph k. reeves was charged with two counts of felony murder for the sexual assault and murder of janet mesner and victoria lamm, both of lincoln, nebraska. under nebraska law, felony murder is a form of first-degree murder committed in the perpetration of certain felonies, including sexual assault. a conviction for felony murder renders a defendant eligible for the death penalty; however the jury does not charge the defendant because capital sentencing is a judicial function. in his trial reeves requested the jury be given other options rather than just felony murder. the trial court judge denied reeves's motion and he was subsequently convicted on both counts. a three-judge panel sentenced reeves to death. the nebraska supreme court affirmed his convictions and sentences. after exhausting his state remedies, reeves filed a federal habeas corpus petition that the trial court's failure to give the requested instructions was unconstitutional. the district court granted relief on an unrelated due process claim. the court of appeals rejected the lower court's decision, but held that a constitutional error had occurred.

ressam argued, and the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit agreed, that the statute required the explosive device to be carried in relation to the underlying felony and, therefore, should not be applied to ressam in this case. the ninth circuit noted congressional amendment of a substantially similar statute to include such ""in relation to"" language, indicating the legislature's intent that a connection between the explosives and the underlying felony is indispensable to the claim. the government, noting the case's importance in the realm of terror prosecutions, urged the court to grant certiorari based on decisions reaching the opposite conclusion in both the third and fifth circuits."

on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the eight circuit vacated the sentence and sent the case back to the district court with instructions to apply the mandatory minimum. in seeking certiorari, greenlaw argued that the eight circuit had ignored substantial high court precedent holding that an appellate court may not order a higher criminal sentence without a government request to do so. greenlaw further sought clarification of two related issues: whether the lack of a government appeal deprives the appellate court of authority as a matter of jurisdiction or merely as a custom of practice, and whether such appellate court discretion is allowable under federal rule of criminal procedure 52(b), which allows courts to consider plain errors even when the parties do not raise them. the solicitor general, while agreeing with greenlaw that the eighth circuit erred, urged the court to grant certiorari and remand the case for further briefing in order to give the appellate court an opportunity to revisit its holding."

in ruling on culbertson’s fee requests, the district court relied on 11th circuit precedent limiting the total fee amount awarded under both § 406(a) and 406(b) to 25% of the past-due benefits awarded to the claimants. this meant that in one case his fee award was limited to 25% of the past-due benefits, in two cases the district court declined to rule on the § 406(b) fee award until the commissioner ruled on the §406(a) award (so as to not award him an amount that exceeded 25% of the past-due benefits), and that in the final case, the court granted his § 406(b) request but barred him from requesting any further fees under § 406(a), again seeking to prevent him from exceeding the 25% cap. 
in his appeal, culbertson contended that other circuits have not applied this 25% cap to the aggregate fee amount awardable under both § 406(a) and (b), but instead applied that limit only to § 406(b) fees. the 11th circuit rejected this argument, applying its prior precedent to affirm the district court’s ruling."

1883	"the maryland dna collection act (mdca) allows state and local law enforcement officers to collect dna samples from individuals who are arrested for a crime of violence, an attempted crime of violence, burglary, or attempted burglary. alonzo jay king, jr. was arrested on first and second degree assault charges. while under arrest, but prior to conviction, king's dna was collected and logged in maryland's dna database. that database matched king's dna to a dna sample from an unsolved rape case. this sample was the only evidence linking king to the rape. the trial judge denied king's motion to suppress the dna evidence and he was convicted of first-degree rape and sentenced to life in prison.
king appealed the conviction, arguing that the mdca was an unconstitutional infringement of his fourth amendment privilege against warrantless searches. the court of appeals of maryland reversed, holding that the mdca was unconstitutional. the court held that king's expectation of privacy was greater than maryland's interest in using the dna for identification purposes."

1884	"gary and venida thacker filed a lawsuit against the tennessee valley authority (tva) for its alleged negligence involving an accident on the tennessee river. the thackers and a friend were participating in a fishing tournament on the river at the same time the tva was attempting to raise a downed power line in the same part of the river. an electrical component struck gary thacker and the friend, severely injuring thacker and killing the friend instantly.
the district court dismissed the thackers’ lawsuit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed.
the united states enjoys sovereign immunity from suit unless it unequivocally waives its immunity by statute. this immunity extends to government agencies, as well. tva is a corporate agency expressly authorized to engage in commercial, power-generating activities, and the tva act expressly provides that tva “may sue and be sued in its corporate name,” subject to certain exceptions. extrapolating from a principle of the federal tort claims act, the eleventh circuit has held that tva cannot be subject to liability when engaged in governmental functions that are discretionary in nature. applying its own precedent, the eleventh circuit found that tva was engaged in exactly this type of function at the time of the accident with the thackers and thus was immune from suit."

thuraissigiam filed a habeas petition in federal district court, arguing that his expedited removal order violated his statutory, regulatory, and constitutional rights. the district court dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that 8 u.s.c. § 1252(e) did not authorize jurisdiction over thuraissigiam’s claims and rejecting his argument that the removal process to which he was subjected effectively suspended the writ of habeas corpus, in violation of the suspension clause.
a panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the district court. because the administrative scheme governing credible fear determinations in this context is “meager,” and § 1252(a)(2) disallows judicial review of whether dhs complied with the procedures, the process does not meet minimum constitutional requirements."

at trial, the defense presented evidence of circumstances mitigating eddings’ guilt, including the details of his extensive juvenile record in missouri. eddings’ parents divorced when he was five, after which he was shuffled between his mother’s house and his father’s house and also spent some time in a group home. witnesses testified that eddings was emotionally disturbed and at a level several years below his age in terms of mental and emotional development. a state psychologist testified that eddings had a sociopathic or antisocial personality disorder.
the state provided evidence of aggravating circumstances. oklahoma alleged 1) that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, 2) that the crime was committed to avoid a lawful arrest, and 3) that there was a probability that the defendant would commit more criminal acts of violence constituting a threat to society. the trial judge found that the state proved all three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. the judge also found that eddings’ age was a mitigating factor of great weight, but would not consider evidence of eddings’ “violent background.” the judge then found that the aggravating circumstances proven by the state outweighed the fact of eddings’ age and sentenced him to death. the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma affirmed the sentence, also holding that eddings' death penalty sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth and fourteenth amendments."

1902	"since 1958, sunkist growers, inc. organized as an agricultural collective, and about 12,000 growers of citrus fruit belonged to this collective. sunkist grouped these growers into local associations, each with a designated packing house for preparing fruit for market. most of these associations were comprised entirely of fruit growers operating under a cooperative structure, but about five percent were corporate growers with their own packing houses. an additional fifteen percent of the associations were private for-profit corporations and partnerships; these associations operated by marketing contracts, not by the cooperative structure.
sunkist controlled approximately seventy percent of all oranges produced in southern california and arizona. this control manifested in several ways. each grower in a cooperative local association agreed to market all fruit through his association, to appoint the association as the marketing agent for all his fruit, and to contract with one packing house. while each association reserved the right to decide its prices and markets, sunkist had sole discretion to pool products for exports, and could set maximum supplies for a given area.

on appeal the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed, holding that lawa was not preempted explicitly or impliedly by the federal immigration reform and control act (""irca""). the court reasoned that irca although irca expressly preempts all state and local laws imposing sanctions for hiring or recruiting unauthorized aliens, it excepts licensing laws – like lawa – from preemptive reach. the court also reasoned that mandating the use of e-verify is not impliedly preempted by irca because congress could have, but did not, expressly forbid states form requiring e-verify participation."

in john r. sand's appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit, the issue of the statute of limitations was raised again - not by either of the parties, but by a group of corporations who were not parties to the case. citing its own precedents, the federal circuit ruled that the statute of limitations was jurisdictional. jurisdictional requirements determine whether courts can hear a case. they cannot be waived by the parties to the case, and courts can consider jurisdictional issues on the courts' own initiative. the federal circuit ruled that john r. sand's claim accrued no later than 1994. since the suit fell outside the time limit, the federal circuit ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and it dismissed the case without considering the merits of the fifth amendment claim."

on september 28, 1956, marc d leh brought an action against general petroleum corportation and five other petroleum manufacturers alleging injury to his business caused by a conspiracy or combination to exclude leh from engaging in wholesale distribution of gasoline in southern california. he alleged that this conspiracy began in 1948; all parties agreed that leh's right to initiate a cause of action began in february of 1954. leh anticipated a statute of limitations problem under california law, as california's code of civil procedure specified a one-year statute of limitations for penal causes of action, in contrast to the clayton act's four-year limit. hence, leh cited to united states v. standard oil, in which the united states alleged a conspiracy to control prices among a nearly identical set of defendants and successfully applied the clayton act's longer limit.
district court judge william mathes ruled in favor of general petroleum, holding that the tripling of damages was a penalty, and was thus barred by the statute of limitations under california law. the court also held that the clayton act did not apply to the claim --distinguishing on the facts from standard oil -- primarily because leh did not allege that the defendants combined to control prices, did not name the same set of defendants, and did not allege a similar period of conspiracy. judge stanley barnes of the u.s. court of appeals, ninth circuit, affirmed. judge barnes affirmed the lower court's interpretation of california law, and that the application of the clayton act used in standard oil did not apply here because the facts were not similar enough to justify collateral estoppel."

1918	"arizona police went to the home of rodney gant in search of drugs and to arrest him for failing to appear in court. when they arrived at the house, gant was not there (though two other people were in his home, one of whom was in possession of a crack pipe) but while the police were still at the house gant pulled into the driveway. while gant was still in his car, an officer shined a flashlight into the vehicle, but the police made no other contact with him until he stepped out of the car. after he was out of the car, the police searched it and found drugs and a handgun. gant was arrested and charged with possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia.
before trial, gant asked the judge to rule the evidence found in the car unconstitutional because the search had been conducted without a warrant in violation of the fourth amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. the trial judge denied the motion, ruling that the search was a direct result of gant's lawful arrest and therefore an exception to the general fourth amendment warrant requirement under new york v. belton (1981). gant was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison.
gant appealed, and the arizona court of appeals reversed the conviction, ruling the search unconstitutional. the court found that exceptions to the fourth amendment warrant requirement must be justified by concerns for officer safety or evidence preservation. the court ruled that these justifications did not apply in gant's case because he had left the vehicle voluntarily without being stopped by police or asked to get out of the car. the search of the vehicle was therefore not directly connected to the arrest and, without that justification, clearly violated the fourth amendment."

1919	"on october 11, 1979, the carter-mondale presidential committee (cmpc) requested time for a thirty-minute program from each of the three major television networks on behalf of president jimmy carter. columbia broadcasting system, inc. (cbs) refused to make the requested time available, emphasizing in part the potential disruption of regular programming. cbs offered to sell the cmpc two five-minute segments instead. the american broadcasting companies (abc) and the national broadcasting company (nbc) each replied that it had not yet begun to sell political time for the 1980 presidential campaign. on october 29, 1979, the cmpc filed a complaint with the federal communications commission (fcc), charging that the networks violated their obligations under the federal communications act.
the federal communications act of 1934, as modified by the federal election campaign act of 1971, authorized the fcc to revoke broadcasting station licenses for willful or repeated failure to allow reasonable access or failure to permit the purchase of reasonable amounts of time for the use of a broadcasting station by a legally qualified candidate for federal elective office. on november 26, 1979, the fcc ruled in a four-to-three vote that the networks violated the act, rejecting the networks’ arguments that congress did not intend the act to create a new right of access to the broadcast media and that the fcc improperly substituted its judgment for the networks’ in evaluating the cmpc’s request for time. 
following the seizure of american embassy personnel in iran in november 1979, the cmpc decided to postpone the broadcast of its thirty-minute program; it successfully purchased five minutes of time from cbs, and later purchased thirty minutes of time for the full program from abc and nbc. throughout these negotiations, however, all parties maintained their rights relating to the appeal to the fcc’s decision. the united states court of appeals, d.c. circuit, affirmed the fcc’s decision. it held that the act created a new, affirmative right of access to broadcast media for candidates for federal office and that the fcc had the authority to evaluate whether a campaign has begun for purposes of the statute."

1922	in 1991, p. d. w. &amp; a., inc., an insolvent corporation taxed under subchapter s, excluded its entire discharge of indebtedness amount from its gross income. david gitlitz and other shareholders were assessed tax deficiencies because they used the untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their basis in s corporation stock and to deduct suspended losses. ultimately, the tax court held that gitlitz and others could not use an s corporation's untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their basis in corporate stock. in affirming, the court of appeals held that the discharge of indebtedness amount first had to be used to reduce certain tax attributes of the s corporation and that only the leftover amount could be used to increase their basis. in so holding, the court assumed that the excluded discharge of indebtedness is an item of income subject to passthrough to shareholders.

the district court ruled that the foundation lacked standing to sue. the court held that the exceptions only covered challenges to specific congressional expenditures, not executive-branch actions funded by the general funds allotted to the executive departments. the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit reversed, ruling that any taxpayer has standing to bring an establishment clause challenge against an executive-branch program, whether funded by a specific congressional grant or by a discretionary use of a general appropriation."

1925	the executors of otis c. hubert's substantial estate filed a federal estate tax return about a year after his death. subsequently, the commissioner of internal revenue issued a notice of deficiency, claiming underreporting of federal estate tax liability caused by the estate's asserted entitlement to marital and charitable deductions. while the estate's redetermination petition was pending in the tax court, the interested parties settled on the use of the estate's assets. the agreement divided the estate's principal, assumed to be worth $26 million, equally between marital trusts and a charitable trust. it also provided that the estate would pay its administration expenses either from the principal or the income of the assets. the estate paid about $500,000 of its nearly $2 million of administration expenses from principal and the rest from income. it then recalculated its tax liability, reducing the marital and charitable deductions by the amount of principal, but not the amount of income, used to pay the expenses. the commissioner concluded that using income for expenses required a dollar for dollar reduction of the deductions. the tax court disagreed, finding that no reduction was required by reason of the executors' power, or the exercise of their power, to pay administration expenses from income. the court of appeals affirmed.

1954	"michael christopher and frank buchanan began working for glaxosmithkline llc (""glaxo"") as pharmaceutical sales representatives (""psrs"") in 2003. glaxo developed, produced, marketed and sold pharmaceutical products to distributors or retail pharmacies, which subsequently sell those products to consumers when authorized by doctors via prescription. the plaintiffs worked between ten and twenty hours outside of normal business hours each week. psrs are compensated with a salary and additional incentive-based pay; they are not paid overtime for work done outside of standard business hours.
the fair labor standards act (""flsa"") was enacted in 1938 to protect the well-being of workers. it imposed a baseline overtime wage on employers for employees who work over forty hours a week. there was an exception to the rule for ""outside salesmen"", defined by the secretary of labor (""secretary"") as an employee whose primary duty is making sales or obtaining contracts and who is primarily and regularly engaged outside of the employer's office. christopher and buchanan filed suit in august of 2008, alleging that glaxo's practice of requiring overtime work without additional pay violated the flsa's overtime provisions. both parties filed for summary judgment, and the district court found for glaxo, agreeing that the plaintiffs fell within the flsa's ""outside salesman"" exception.
the u.s. court of appeals for the the ninth circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. the secretary filed an amicus curiae brief in support of christopher and buchanan's position, arguing that when a psr promotes pharmaceutical products but does not receive items of value in exchange for those products, he does not fall within the ""outside salesman"" exception to the flsa. the court rejected the secretary's argument, however, reasoning that this definition is a simple parroting of the congressional statute; such definitions require less deference by courts because they are not interpretive. instead, the court pointed to christopher and buchanan's training in sales --and their experience in sales as a qualification for employment by glaxo-- as evidence of their status as ""outside salesmen."" the court noted that the pharmaceutical industry self-regulated marketing to doctors much like other industries self-regulate direct-to-consumer marketing."

1955	the fourth amendment prohibits the unreasonable seizure of a person by the government, and the fourteenth amendment applies that prohibition to the states. on october 10, 1974, george summers was leaving his house in detroit, michigan, as local police officers arrived with a warrant to search the property for narcotics. the officers requested that summers help them gain entry to the house, and they detained him while they searched the premises. after finding two packages of heroin in the basement, the officers arrested summers and searched his person. in his coat pocket, they found an envelope containing heroin, and it was this discovery of heroin⎯not the heroin found in the basement⎯that formed the basis of charges against summers. at trial, summers argued that the search of his person was illegal because the officers had no authority to detain him during their search of the house. the trial judge agreed and granted summers’ motion to suppress the heroin evidence. on appeal, the state argued that summers’ detention was reasonable, given his close proximity to the house when the officers arrived to perform the search. the state also contended that the concealable nature of the narcotics described in the warrant implicitly authorized the search of people found on the property. the michigan court of appeals affirmed the trial court’s order. the state appealed to the supreme court of michigan, which affirmed the ruling of the lower court.

the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed mr. abuelhawa's conviction. it reasoned that mr. abuelhawa's use of a cell phone facilitated cocaine distribution because his telephone call made the distribution of cocaine ""easier"" for his dealer, which is a felony, thus section 843(b) properly applies."

the supreme court of montana consolidated both cases to decide whether montana courts have personal jurisdiction over bnsf under fela and whether montana courts have personal jurisdiction over bnsf under montana law. bnsf argued that, under the u.s. supreme court’s decision in daimler ag v. bauman, the state courts cannot exercise general jurisdiction. however, the montana supreme court rejected that argument and held that, because bnsf does business in montana, under fela, montana courts have personal jurisdiction. montana’s supreme court also held that the state has general personal jurisdiction over bnsf under montana law because bnsf “maintains substantial, continuous, and systematic” contacts with montana."

argus filed a lawsuit against the usda in federal district court, which found that the usda properly withheld the information under foia exemption 3, which applies to information prohibited from disclosure by another federal law. on appeal, the eighth circuit reversed, finding that exemption 3 did not apply to the contested data, and remanded the case back to the district court. on remand, the issue before the court was whether exemption 4—which covers “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential”—applied to the information sought.
for the purpose of applying exemption 4, the circuit courts have adopted a definition of “confidential” different from the term’s ordinary meaning. courts have held the term to mean that exemption 4 applies only if disclosure is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the source of the information. there is a circuit split as to what “substantial competitive harm” means. the district court in this case adopted the definition from the dc circuit, which has held that “competitive harm may be established if there is evidence of ‘actual competition and the likelihood of substantial competitive injury.’”  appling that definition to the facts at hand, the court found speculative the usda’s claims of competitive injury and entered judgment for argus. the usda decided not to appeal the judgment, so petitioner food marketing institute (fmi) intervened and filed the appeal. on appeal, the eighth circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court."

1990	"amanda mitchell and others were indicted for offenses arising from a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. mitchell was charged with one count of conspiring to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine. mitchell pleaded guilty, but reserved the right to contest the drug quantity attributable to her under the conspiracy count during her sentencing hearing. before accepting her plea, the district court told mitchell that she faced a mandatory minimum of 1 year in prison for distributing cocaine and a 10-year minimum for conspiracy if the government could show the required 5 kilograms. the court also explained to mitchell that by pleading guilty she would be waiving her right ""at trial to remain silent."" at mitchell's sentencing hearing, the district court found, after hearing testimony that included some of mitchell's codefendants, that mitchell's alleged drug sales of 1 1/2 to 2 ounces of cocaine twice a week for year and a half put her over the 5-kilogram threshold. mitchell did not testify to rebut the government's evidence about drug quantity; however, her counsel argued the quantity of cocaine attributable to her for sentencing purposes. the district court ruled that as a consequence of mitchell's guilty plea, she had no right to remain silent about her crime's details; found that the codefendants' testimony put her over the 5-kilogram threshold, thus mandating the 10-year minimum; and noted that her failure to testify was a factor in persuading the court to rely on the codefendants' testimony. the court of appeals affirmed."

evans filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  the district court denied the writ, but the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed, holding that the georgia statute violates evans right to confrontation because it is broader than the rule used in federal conspiracy trials.  the court found no “cogent reasons” for the georgia hearsay exception."

upon obduskey’s appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the tenth circuit, the appellate court held that based on the statute’s plain language as well as policy considerations, the fdcpa did not apply to non-judicial foreclosure proceedings in colorado. it agreed with the district court’s finding that wells fargo was not a debt collector because obduskey was not in default when it began servicing the loan. it also held that mccarthy was not a debt collector under the fdcpa because attempting to enforce a security interest was not the same as attempting to collect a money debt.
in reaching this conclusion, the tenth circuit joined the ninth circuit, and ruled in conflict with the outcomes reached on this topic in the fourth, fifth, and sixth circuits.

jones, however, argued that a separate section of u.s.c. extended the statute of limitations to four years for any civil suit brought under an act of congress passed after 1990. because the 1991 civil rights act had broadened the definition of section 1981, she argued, the four-year statute of limitations should apply to that section and the suit should therefore not be thrown out. donnelley and sons countered that the 1991 civil rights act had merely amended the section, not created a new law, and that the four-year statute of limitations therefore did not apply.

in 2015, the lundgrens filed suit to quiet title to the property, seeking summary judgment on the basis that they had acquired the disputed property by adverse possession or mutual acquiescence and recognition long before the tribe bought its parcel. the tribe moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity, and because the lundgrens could not join them as a necessary and indispensable party. the trial court denied the tribe’s motion, and the tribe sought direct discretionary review. in the resulting ruling, the court granted the lundgrens’ motion for summary judgment, finding that they had established legal ownership of the disputed property through adverse possession and mutual recognition and acquiescence.
the washington supreme court accepted the tribe’s amended motion for discretionary review of both prior orders, and affirmed. the court rejected the argument that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to the tribe’s sovereign immunity, which neither the tribe nor congress had waived with regard to quiet title actions. the court found that because it had in rem jurisdiction, the tribe’s sovereign immunity did not create a barrier to jurisdiction."

plaintiffs are various civil rights groups that are challenging the process, claiming that it is not only inappropriate to remove individuals from the voter rolls as a consequence of failing to vote but also violates part of the national voter registration act of 1993. the act prohibits a program for voter-list maintenance for federal elections that involves “the removal of the name of any personal from the official list of voters . . . by reason of the person’s failure to vote.” plaintiffs believe that the supreme court should involve itself and determine whether this process violates the act. the u.s. court of appeals for the 6th circuit previously struck down these rules, deeming them a violation of federal voting law because ohio's process involves using an individual's failure to vote as a ""trigger"" for sending out a confirmation notice to that person. plaintiffs consequently argue that there is no reason to disturb the appellate court decision. defendants argue that ohio is adhering to federal voter law, as set forth in the national voter registration act of 1993 (nvra) and the help america vote act of 2002 (hava)."

2060	in 1972, texas became a covered jurisdiction for purposes of section 5 of voting rights act of 1965. by statute, texas authorizes counties to appoint election judges, who supervise voting at the polls on election days. in 1983 and several times thereafter, dallas county changed procedures for selecting election judges. each of the new methods used party-affiliation formulas. in 1996, various parties brought suit in federal district court against the county, claiming that section 5 required the changes to be precleared by the u.s. department of justice. the district court concluded that preclearance was not required, as the county had simply exercised its discretion under a state statute to adjust the procedure for appointing election judges. the court also noted that department's preclearance of a 1985 submission from the state operated to preclear the county's use of partisan considerations in selecting election judges.

2061	"after the 2000 census reduced the size of the pennsylvania congressional delegation by two members, the republican-controlled state legislature passed a redistricting plan that clearly benefitted republican candidates. several members of the democratic party sued in federal court, claiming that the plan was unconstitutional because it violated the one-person, one-vote principle of article i, section 2 of constitution, the equal protection clause, the privileges and immunities clause, and the freedom of association.
the district court dismissed all but the article i, section 2 claim. it held that the voters bringing the suit had not proved that they would be denied representation, only that they would be represented by republican officials. because the plaintiffs (those bringing the suit) were not denied the right to vote, to be placed on the ballot box, to associate as a party, or to express their political opinions, their political discrimination claims failed.
however, the court found the act unconstitutional because it created districts with different numbers of voters, thereby violating the one-person, one-vote principle. because the plaintiffs had shown that it was possible to create districts with smaller differences, and because the defendants had failed to justify the disparities resulting under their plan, it was therefore unconstitutional."

in 2002, the supreme court decided the case ring v. arizona, in which the court held that the sixth amendment required that the presence of aggravating factors, which arizona’s death penalty sentencing scheme viewed as essentially elements of a larger offense, be determined by the jury. the supreme court of florida had previously held that the decision in ring v. arizona did not apply to florida’s death penalty sentencing scheme generally and specifically did not require that a jury’s recommendation of the death penalty be unanimous or that a jury determine the factual issue of a defendant’s potential mental retardation."

(alafabco) had multiple business dealings with each other spanning over a decade. in 1998, alafabco bid on a construction job based on a contract it had with citizens to finance the project. when citizens did not finance the project, alafabco used existing funds meant to repay the debts it owed to citizens to fund the project and subsequently defaulted on its loan payments to citizens. citizens and alafabco composed two different debt-restructuring agreements, both of which included arbitration clauses that stated that the federal arbitration act (faa) would apply. alafabco sued citizens in alabama state court for breach of contract and claimed that it had incurred detrimental debt because of citizens’ breach. citizens invoked the arbitration clause, and the state court ordered the parties to submit to arbitration pursuant to their agreement. the supreme court of alabama reversed and held that, because the debt-restructuring agreements did not substantially involve interstate commerce, the faa did not apply to the parties’ disputes.

2099	"frank varela filed a class action complaint against his employer, lamps plus, under theories including negligence, invasion of privacy, and breach of contract after the company released employee personal identifying information in response to a phishing scam. varela had signed an arbitration agreement as a condition of his employment. after he filed suit, lamps plus relied on this agreement as a basis for a motion to compel bilateral arbitration.&nbsp;
the district court found the agreement to be a contract of adhesion and ambiguous as to whether it permitted class arbitration. it construed the ambiguity against the drafter, lamps plus, and allowed the arbitration to proceed on a class-wide basis. lamps plus appealed, arguing that it had not agreed to class arbitration, but the ninth circuit affirmed and ruled that class arbitration could move forward.
the appeals court explained that because the agreement was capable of two reasonable interpretations, the district court was correct in finding ambiguity. under california law it was also proper to construe the ambiguity against the drafter, particularly since it was a contract of adhesion. further, it was a reasonable interpretation of the agreement to conclude that it covered legal disputes including class-wide claims, not just individual ones. by accepting this interpretation, the district court had found the requisite “contractual basis” for agreement to class arbitration under stolt-nielsen s.a. v. animalfeeds int’l corp., 559 u.s. 662 (2010)."

the federal district court held that the individual mandate is now unconstitutional and that as a result, the entire aca is invalidated because the individual mandate cannot be “severed” from the rest of the act. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit upheld the district court’s conclusion but remanded the case for reconsideration of whether any part of the aca survives in the absence of the individual mandate. the supreme court granted california’s petition for review, as well as texas’s cross-petition for review."

the u.s. court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that the district court should not have remanded the case because requiring the party requesting the removal to produce evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million creates an evidentiary burden. the court of appeals held that that such evidence is wholly unnecessary unless the removal is contested. a party requesting that a case be removed to federal court need only allege that the grounds for removal exist and need only prove those allegations if they are contested."

the ninth circuit found unpersuasive dutra group’s argument, finding that the court in miles considered only damages for loss of society and of future earnings, not punitive damages. while miles does limit recovery for “pecuniary loss,” punitive damages are not “pecuniary loss,” which means simply loss of money. thus, miles left undisturbed the ninth circuit’s opinion in evich."

on appeal to the minnesota supreme court, danforth raised an alternative argument, claiming that the state court was free to apply a broader standard of retroactivity than the one in teague. under minnesota state retroactivity principles, danforth argued, the crawford case met the criteria for retroactive application. in danforth's interpretation, the teague standard was mandatory for federal habeas corpus proceedings but not for state postconviction proceedings. the minnesota supreme court rejected danforth's arguments, ruling that only u.s. supreme court decisions determine the proper standard for retroactive application of constitutional criminal procedure. the supreme court subsequently ruled in whorton v. bockting that crawford does not apply retroactively under teague, but it agreed to consider danforth's alternative argument."

2131	"during the early morning hours of october 30, 1966, an individual approached a police officer in a gas station parking lot in bridgeport, connecticut, and informed him that another individual in a nearby vehicle was carrying narcotics and had a gun at his waist. the officer approached the vehicle on foot and asked the occupant, robert williams, to open the door. when williams rolled down the window instead, the officer reached into the car and removed a gun from williams’ waistband, though the gun was not visible from outside the vehicle. the officer then arrested williams for unlawful possession of a firearm and proceeded to search his vehicle, where he found heroin. williams was convicted in a connecticut state court of possession of a handgun and heroin.
after the supreme court of connecticut affirmed the conviction, williams filed a claim against the prison warden, frederick adams, in which he alleged that the state of connecticut continued to detain him unlawfully as a prisoner. williams argued that the handgun and drugs were discovered through an unlawful search and should not have been admitted into evidence at his trial. the district court denied his petition. on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit sided with williams and ordered that his conviction be set aside.

hyatt challenged the conclusions by filing protests with ftb and then in california courts. in 1998, hyatt sued ftb in nevada state court seeking damages for intentional torts and bad-faith conduct allegedly committed by ftb auditors during tax audits of hyatt’s 1991 and 1992 state tax returns.
ftb filed a motion for partial summary judgment challenging the nevada district court’s jurisdiction over hyatt’s declaratory relief cause of action. the district court granted partial summary judgment, finding that the timing of hyatt’s move from california to nevada should be resolved via the administrative investigation. ftb also asked the nevada supreme court to decide whether it was entitled to complete immunity under several theories: it enjoyed complete immunity under california law, it was entitled to sovereign immunity, the full faith and credit clause, and comity. the nevada supreme court concluded ftb was not entitled to complete immunity under any of these principles, but was entitled to partial immunity equal to the immunity a nevada government agency would receive. thus, the court concluded that ftb was immune from the negligence cause of action, but not from the intentional tort causes of action.
ftb appealed to the us supreme court, and the court upheld the court’s determination that ftb was entitled only to partial immunity under comity principles. two other questions from this litigation made their way to the us supreme court, and the court (1) split 4–4 as to whether it should overrule nevada v. hall, which provides “that one state ... can open the doors of its courts to a private citizen’s lawsuit against another state ... without the other state’s consent,” and (2) held that the constitution does not permit nevada to award damages against california agencies under its state law that are greater than it could award against nevada agencies in similar circumstances. with these preliminary legal questions resolved, a nevada jury finally found in favor of hyatt and awarded him $85 million for emotional distress, $52 million for invasion of privacy, over $1 for special damages for fraud, and $250 million in punitive damages. the nevada supreme court issued upholding the damages, subject to the statutory caps to which ftb is entitled, consistent with the us supreme court’s holding on that issue.

mrs. dial's mother, alberta singleton, filed a writ of habeas corpus on her daughter's behalf and argued that civilian dependents of military personnel cannot be tried in a military court. the circuit court judge stated he did not want to grant the writ of habeas corpus but was bound by the supreme court case reid v. covert, in which the court held that non-military personnel cannot be court martialed for capital offenses. nina kinsella, the warden where mrs. dial was serving her time, appealed the writ and argued that the defendant in reid v. covert was on trial for a capital offense, whereas mrs. dial was on a trial for a non-capital offense. therefore, the court was not bound by that case."

2161	"on the night of october 10, 1960, internal revenue service agents, along with a state patrol officer, went to the site of the ""apinook mill"" in jarrett city, connecticut. agents gained entrance to the grounds, smelled the distinctive odor of ground mash indicating the presence of a still, and visually confirmed the presence of a column still in building 9a. the federal agents then applied for a warrant, after noting that the treasury department had not registered the still in question. the warrant was granted on october 11th.
on october 13th, federal agents entered building 9a by force after demanding entry and hearing no reply. they discovered an operating still inside, and found frank romano and john ottiano standing nearby. ottiano had the key to the facility on his person. romano stated that he had been at the site for four days and claimed not to know how long the operation had existed.
section 5601(b)(1) of the excise tax technical changes act of 1958 (""ettca""), established a presumption of guilt for anyone shown to be at the place or site of an unregistered still. section 5601(b)(1) was an amendment to section 5601(a)(1), which defines the crime of possessing an unregistered still.
the united states charged romano and ottiano with three counts: possession of an illegal still, the illegal production of distilled spirits, and conspiracy to produce distilled spirits. judge t. emmet clarie instructed the jury with a verbatim reading of the relevant provisions of the ettca. the jury found both men guilty of all counts. the court sentenced romano and ottiano to concurrent sentences on all three counts and fined them for possession of the unregistered still.
chief judge j. edward lumbard of the u.s. court of appeals, second circuit, reversed the sentences for possession and illegal production of spirits. he held that the trial court's application of section 5601(b)(1) was an unconstitutional violation of romano and ottiano's fifth amendment due process rights. he reasoned that the inference of possession did not necessarily follow from a defendant's presence, given that the defendant could be a purchaser of the product or simply a visitor to the site."

while the case was pending, congress designated sunrise rock a national memorial and barred its dismantling with the use of federal funds. one year later, by land swap, congress made sunrise rock private property in exchange for another parcel of land. mr. buono moved to not only enforce the previous court order preventing the display of the cross, but also to prohibit the land swap. the district court granted both motions. the secretary of the interior appealed, arguing that the district court abused its discretion.

the fair debt collection practices act (""fdcpa"") prohibited communications with third parties in connection with the collection of debt. it also allowed courts to award costs to prevailing defendants in actions brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment. rule 54(d) of the federal rules of civil procedure, however, prevented courts from awarding courts if a statute provided otherwise. marx sued grc in october 2008, alleging abusive and threatening phone calls in violation of the fdcpa. she amended her complaint in march 2009 to add a claim that grc violated the fdcpa by sending the fax to her workplace to request employment information.
the district court dismissed her complaint, holding that the fax was not a ""communication"" within the meaning of the act, and ordering marx to pay court costs. the united states court of appeals, tenth circuit, affirmed with one dissent, holding that the fax was not a communication. the tenth circuit also held that the act did not prevent courts from awarding costs to prevailing defendants. marx's petition for an en banc rehearing was denied."

in 2011, the new jersey legislature held a referendum asking voters whether sports gambling should be permitted, and 64 percent voted in favor of a state constitutional amendment that would permit sports gambling. the legislature then drafted and received voter approval of a sports-wagering constitutional amendment, after which time, in 2012, it enacted the sports wagering act (""2012 act""), which authorized certain regulated sports wagering at new jersey casinos and racetracks and implemented a comprehensive regulatory scheme for licensing casinos and sporting events.
five sports leagues sued under paspa to enjoin the new jersey law, which the state defended by arguing that paspa was unconstitutional under the anti-commandeering doctrine. the district court held that paspa was constitutional and enjoined the 2012 act. the legislature passed a second law (""2014 law"") that purported to repeal the regulatory scheme for licensing casinos and sporting events, effectively providing tacit authorization of them. the leagues again sued to enjoin the 2014 law, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the leagues and issued a permanent injunction against the governor and other state agencies. a divided panel of the third circuit affirmed, and upon rehearing, the third circuit en banc affirmed the majority opinion of the panel."

2255	"minnesota statute § 211b.ii prohibits individuals from wearing political apparel at or around polling places on primary or election days. the text of the statute did not define “political”, so minnesota election officials distributed policy materials to help identify which items fell within the scope of the law. election officials received instructions to request that anyone wearing apparel which violated the guidelines laid out in the policy materials remove or cover it up. while officials were instructed to allow the person to vote regardless of their compliance, misdemeanor prosecution was a possible outcome, should an individual refuse the removal or cover-up request.
this case arose when andrew cilek, executive director for minnesota voters alliance, was temporarily prevented from voting at his local polling place in november 2010 because he was wearing a t-shirt with a tea party logo and a button that advocated for the requirement of a photo id to vote.
minnesota majority, minnesota voters alliance, and minnesota northstar tea party patriots, along with their association election integrity watch (eiw), filed a lawsuit against the minnesota secretary of state and various county election officials to enjoin enforcement of the statute as unconstitutional. the parties claimed that the statute violated the first amendment, facially and as-applied, and was selectively enforced, which also violated their equal protection rights.
initially, the district court dismissed all claims. the eighth circuit affirmed as to the claims regarding equal protection and facial first amendment violations. it reversed and remanded the as-applied first amendment claim. the district court ultimately granted summary judgment against eiw, et al., on the as-applied first amendment claim. reviewing de novo the grant of summary judgment against eiw, the eighth circuit considered eiw's claim that the minnesota statute was not reasonable, as applied to tea party apparel, because the tea party is not a political party in minnesota. the eighth circuit was unpersuaded and held that the district court was correct in its ruling, since eiw had failed to present specific facts that showed banning tea party apparel was not reasonable, given the minnesota statute's purpose. the eighth circuit held that eiw's argument that voters in tea party apparel were affected by selective enforcement had also failed, as it offered nothing more than speculation that voters wearing other forms of political apparel avoided enforcement of the statute. eiw, et al., then petitioned the supreme court to decide whether the lower courts’ ruling was correct. 
eiw indicates in their petition for a writ of certiorari that there is a circuit split on the issues presented, where the eighth circuit’s ruling aligns with the d.c. and fifth circuit, which both have held that the government has authority to ban forms of political speech near polling places. the fourth and seventh circuits have held, by contrast, that a complete ban on all political speech, absent any limiting principle, is unconstitutional, regardless of the location in which such speech has been banned."

buck filed various claims for state and federal habeas relief that were denied, until the u.s. supreme court decided trevino v. thaler, which held that texas’ procedural scheme made it almost impossible to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal, and therefore that a procedural default on such a claim could be excused. while some of these claims were pending, the state attorney general admitted in a different case that the state should not have called an expert witness to testify about future dangerousness of a defendant based on race and named buck’s case as one affected by similar testimony. buck again sought federal habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel knowingly called an expert witness who testified that race was a factor in determining future dangerousness. the district court dismissed the claim because buck failed to show that the outcome of his trial was prejudiced. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit similarly denied buck’s request for a certificate of appealability by holding that buck did not show sufficient extraordinary circumstances to justify relief from the lower court’s judgment."

the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit reversed, stating that phoenix had suffered injury in fact proximately caused by bridge. in seeking certiorari, bridge noted splits between the circuits on the issue of whether a plaintiff must plead and prove reliance on a false statement in a rico claim. although phoenix suggested that proximate cause, not reliance or standing, was the ultimate issue in this case, the court has decided to frame its review around the reliance issue."

(varsity) designs and manufactures clothing and accessories for use in various athletic activities, including cheerleading. design concepts for the clothing incorporate elements such as colors, shapes, lines, etc., and do not consider the functionality of the final clothing. varsity received copyright registration for the two-dimensional artwork of the designs at issue in this case, which were very similar to ones that star athletica, llc (star) was advertising. varsity sued star and alleged, among other claims, that star violated the copyright act. star asserted counterclaims, including one that alleged that varsity had made fraudulent representations to the copyright office because the designs at issue were not copyrightable. both parties filed motions for summary judgment. star argued that varsity did not have valid copyrights because the designs were for “useful articles,” which cannot be copyrighted, and the designs cannot be separated from the uniforms themselves, which also makes the designs impossible to copyright. varsity argued that the designs were separable and non-functional, and therefore that the copyrights were valid and had been infringed. the district court granted summary judgment for star and held that the designs were integral to the functionality of the uniform. the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed and held that the copyright act allows graphic features of a design to be copyrighted even when those designs are not separable from a “useful article.”	False
