2	the state of colorado, like most states, imposes certain monetary penalties upon persons convicted of a crime. shannon nelson and louis madden were both separately arrested and charged with sexual assault crimes. nelson was acquitted of all charges, and madden was acquitted of one of two charges against him. both requested refunds from the state for the penalties they had been charged, since their convictions were overturned. the trial court determined it lacked jurisdiction in nelson’s case and only returned the funds taken from madden in connection with the one charge on which he was acquitted. the colorado court of appeals found that the state must refund the money nelson and madden had paid respective to their sexual assault charges that had been thrown out. the colorado supreme court reversed the decisions in both cases and held that,  under the state’s exoneration act, an individual may only recover monetary losses from an arrest if they can “prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that [they were] ‘actually innocent.’”	True
3	in 1952, arizona invoked the u.s. supreme court's original jurisdiction to resolve a dispute with california over the extent of each state's right to use water from the colorado river. the united states intervened, seeking water rights on behalf of five indian reservations. culminating in arizona i, the court held that the united states had reserved water rights for the five reservations. in a 1964 decree, the court specified the water entitlements for the parties and the reservations, but held that the water rights for the reservations would be subject to adjustment in the event that the reservations' disputed boundaries were finally determined. thereafter in arizona ii, the court concluded that the reservations' boundaries had yet to be determined. ultimately, the quechan tribe (tribe) of the fort yuma indian reservation and the united states entered an agreement returning land encompassing some 25,000 acres of disputed boundary lands not attributed to that reservation in earlier litigation. in 1983, the court of claims consented to the settlement. the tribe and the united states then filed claims seeking increased water rights for the fort yuma reservation. in 1989, the court granted the motion of arizona, california, and two municipal water districts (state parties) to reopen the 1964 decree to determine whether the fort yuma reservation was entitled to claim additional boundary lands and, if so, additional water rights. the state parties asserted that the fort yuma claims of the tribe and the united states were precluded by arizona i and by the claims court consent judgment.

16	"in 1966, congress passed the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966, which gave the secretary of transportation the power to issue motor vehicle safety standards. the secretary also has the ability to delegate that power to another agency, in this case the national highway transportation safety administration (nhtsa). the act also authorizes judicial review to determine whether the nhtsa acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
in 1967, the department of transportation first issued standard 208, which at that point only required all automobiles to have seat belts. by 1975, standard 208 had been revised multiple times to require passive restraints, such as airbags and seat belts that would operate automatically and not require action on the part of the occupants. because of the unpopularity of the standard, in 1974 congress amended the act to allow alternative safety measures. in 1976, secretary of transportation william coleman suspended the passive restraint requirement entirely. the succeeding secretary of transportation, brock adams, issued modified standard 208, which required passive restraints in large cars of model year 1982 or later and in all cars of model year 1984 or later. in 1981, secretary of transportation andrew lewis began reconsidering modified standard 208. the nhtsa rescinded the passive restraint requirement of modified standard 208 because it determined that the restraints would not have the expected safety benefits, so the requirement would not be reasonable or practicable.
state farm mutual automobile insurance company and the national association of independent insurers filed for review of the nhtsa’s decision, and the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that the nhtsa’s decision to rescind the standard was arbitrary and capricious. the court of appeals held that there was not enough evidence to support the nhtsa’s position and that the nhtsa failed to properly consider alternative possibilities under which the standard could be effective."

17	"keith haywood, while incarcerated at the attica correctional facility in attica, new york, was charged with several misbehavior reports in 2003 and 2004, including assaulting a corrections officer, failing a urinalysis test, and improperly soliciting mail. after being found guilty of these charges, haywood commenced actions in state court against two of the corrections officers responsible for reviewing the claims under 42 u.s.c. 1983 (section 1983), a federal statute protecting civil rights. he asserted that the guilty verdicts had been handed down without sufficient evidence, that the officers had tampered with the urinalysis test, and that they had conspired to fabricate the facts set forth in the misbehavior reports. the defendants moved to dismiss haywood's claims, basing their argument on a new york law prohibiting civil claims such as haywood's brought against corrections officers in their official capacities. haywood responded by arguing that when congress created section 1983 it intended the statute to supersede any state laws contradicting it. because section 1983 allowed these claims, haywood argued, the new york law prohibiting them violated the supremacy clause of the u.s. constitution. the supreme court of new york (the state's lowest-level court) agreed with the defendants and dismissed haywood's claim based on the new york law.
the court of appeals of new york affirmed the supreme court's decision, finding that the supremacy clause permits states to deny enforcement of a federal right in a case where a state court lacks jurisdiction due to a neutral state rule regarding the courts' administration. because haywood's claim would be barred if brought under either section 1983 or an applicable state law, the new york law barring the claim was valid and neutral and did not violate the supremacy clause."

in 2011, the epa created the transport rule, a rule which sets emission reduction standards for 28 ""upwind"" states based on the air quality standards in ""downwind"" states. various states, local governments, industry groups, and labor organizations brought suit in the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and argued that the transport rule created federal standards with no deference to the states, which violated federal law. the court held that the transport rule violated federal law because the clean air act allows states to implement their own plans to curb air pollution."

21	"in an effort to address the problem of tobacco use by minors, the maine legislature passed the tobacco delivery law, which imposes requirements on air and motor carriers that transport tobacco products. one provision of the law requires tobacco retailers to only use carriers that verify the age of each tobacco purchaser, and another provision requires that carriers ensure that no tobacco is shipped to unlicensed retailers. the new hampshire motor transport association sued, arguing that the state law was preempted by a federal law, the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 (faaaa). the preemption provision of the faaaa prohibits state from enacting laws ""related to"" the prices, routes, or services of air and motor carriers. the association argued that the tobacco delivery law placed such a burden on the delivery procedures of carriers that significantly affected their prices and services. the state countered that the faaaa was only meant to preempt traditional economic regulation by states, and therefore laws enacted pursuant to the state's police power - the power of a state to regulate for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens - were permissible. the u.s. district court ruled that the law was preempted by the faaaa.
the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed the lower court. the first circuit held that a police power exception to the general rule of preemption would be far too broad and was not intended by congress. maine could validly ban all unlicensed tobacco products within its borders, but the faaaa prohibited the state from implementing this goal by imposing requirements on carriers that significantly alter their delivery procedures."

23	"charles lickteig is a deputy sheriff in kentucky. because he is a hazardous duty worker, he is eligible to retire at age 55. kentucky retirement systems offers a two-tier calculation of so-called ""disability retirement benefits."" if hazardous duty workers like lickteig opt to keep working and then become disabled, they receive only their scheduled retirement benefits. in contrast, workers who become disabled before reaching age 55 receive payments that reflect not only their actual years of service but the number of years remaining until they would have reached 55. in effect, if two workers were otherwise identical, the one who retired on disability before 55 would always get benefits equal to or greater than those of the post-55 retiree.
lickteig decided against retirement at 55. six years later, he became disabled because of ""a deteriorating vertebra, arthritis, nerve damage, and parkinson's disease,"" and stopped working. when he applied for disability retirement benefits, he received word that he was eligible only for standard retirement.
the equal employment opportunity commission argued unsuccessfully in federal district court that the two-tier system violated the age discrimination in employment act (adea). the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed. the appellate court reheard the case en banc and reversed, holding that the simple act of treating younger disabled retirees better than older ones was sufficient to make out a prima facie adea violation."

the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york found that the pretrial detention was a violation of habeas corpus. the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the district court’s decision and determined that the fca was unconstitutional because it allowed detention of juveniles to serve as a punishment before the trial occurred.

the original suit filed in the district court had multiple claims from which this case arose, but all were dismissed in favor of omnicare. the claims were dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to plead that the defendants had knowledge of wrongdoing when they materially falsified information on the registration statement. the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed the dismissals except one filed under §11 for materially misleading or omitting material information because that claim was filed under a strict liability statute which did not require pleading to knowledge of wrongdoing. the court held that plaintiffs had met their burden for making a prima facie case under §11 and remanded the case to district court."

the estate appealed the judgment with respect to its claims, but did not appeal the judgment in favor of samuel because the district court vacated the jury verdict and his claims were still awaiting retrial. samuel argue that the appellate court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal while his claims were still pending in the district court, and the third circuit agreed.
the third circuit relied on its binding precedent in bergman v. city of atlantic city, which held that when two cases have been consolidated for all purposes, a final decision on one set of claims is generally not appealable while the second set remains pending. the estate argues that the supreme court’s decision in gelboim v. bank of america corp. affirming the appealability of final judgment in a case that was part of a multi-district litigation should dictate the outcome of the case and permit the exercise of jurisdiction over the claims that have a final judgment."

46	"this lawsuit arose out of apple’s handling of the sale of apps for its iphone devices. apple released the iphone in 2007, and from the outset, it has been a “closed system,” meaning that apple controls which apps can be loaded onto an iphone, which it does via the “app store.” although apple develops some of the apps sold in the app store, most are developed by third parties. for every app store sale made by a third-party developer, apple receives 30% of the sale price.
in 2011, four named plaintiffs filed a putative antitrust class action complaint against apple, alleging monopolization and attempted monopolization of the iphone app market. the complaint was dismissed on technical grounds, as were several subsequent attempts at similar lawsuits by both the same and other plaintiffs. in september 2013, a set of plaintiffs included in their allegations sufficient facts for the lawsuit to move forward. among these facts was the key allegation that each plaintiff had purchased iphone apps from the app store, and that these transactions involved apple collecting the entire purchase price and paying the developers after the sale.
apple filed yet another motion to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that the plaintiffs lacked statutory standing to sue under the us supreme court’s precedent in illinois brick co. v. illinois, 431 u.s. 720 (1977). under illinois brick, “only the overcharged direct purchaser, and not others in the chain of manufacture or distribution” may bring a lawsuit for antitrust violations. if the plaintiffs are considered to have purchased their iphone apps directly from the app developers, then they cannot sue apple. however, if they are considered to have bought the apps from apple, then they may sue apple.
the district court found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue under illinois brick and dismissed the case with prejudice. on appeal, the ninth circuit reviewed the district court’s decision de novo and found that, contrary to a ruling on the same issue by the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit, the plaintiffs are direct purchasers from apple within the meaning of illinois brick and thus have standing."

hhs contracts with “fiscal intermediaries” to reimburse healthcare service providers for services rendered to medicare part a patients. these intermediaries make an initial payment based on an estimate of the cost of services provided and are later adjusted based on actual cost reports.
the medicare act authorizes reimbursement adjustments to increase payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high number of low-income patients. the rate of adjustment is calculated in part based on the number of “patient days” for patients “entitled to benefits under part a” of medicare. in 2012, hhs sought to interpret this phrase as including patient days for patients entitled to benefits under part c of medicare as well. including part c days in the adjustment calculus would result in lower reimbursement rates, which translates into hundreds of millions of dollars.
the plaintiff hospitals challenged the rate adjustment in the provider reimbursement review board, as required by statute. the board concluded that it lacked authority to resolve the issue, which triggered expedited review before the federal district court. the district court granted summary judgment to hhs, finding that the rate adjustment was an “interpretive rule” under the administrative procedure act (apa) and thus was exempt from the apa’s notice-and-comment requirement for new rules. the hospitals appealed, and the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit reversed, finding that the adjustment was not merely an “interpretive rule” and that hhs violated the medicare act by promulgating the rule without providing notice and the opportunity for comment."

glover moved to suppress all evidence from the stop, arguing that the stop violated his fourth amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. according to glover, the police officer lacked reasonable suspicion to pull him over. the state argued that a law enforcement officer may infer that the owner of a vehicle is the one driving the vehicle, absent information to the contrary, and the knowledge that the owner has a revoked license combined with that inference gives rise to reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop.
the state trial court concluded that it is not reasonable for an officer to infer that the registered owner of a vehicle is also its driver and granted glover’s motion to suppress. the appellate court reversed, and the kansas supreme court granted review. the supreme court reversed the lower court, holding that the inference impermissibly “stacked” assumptions and would relieve the state of its burden of showing reasonable suspicion for a stop."

johnson appealed and argued that the ""strong likelihood"" standard in wheeler was at odds with the 'reasonable inference"" standard the u.s. supreme court set in batson v. kentucky (1986). the appeals court agreed and reversed johnson's conviction. the california supreme court reversed and ruled that the two standards were the same. the u.s. supreme court at first dismissed johnson's appeal because the case was not finalized (see johnson v. california 2004, no. 03-6539). after another round of appeals, however, the court agreed to decide the case."

in 2010, noel canning, a bottler and distributor of pepsi-cola products, was engaged in negotiations with its employee union, the international brotherhood of teamsters local 760 (union). during the final bargaining session that december, noel canning agreed to submit two wage and pension plans to a vote by the union membership. the membership approved the union's preferred proposal. however, noel canning argued that the discussions did not amount to a binding agreement and refused to incorporate the changes into a new collective bargaining agreement. the union filed a complaint with the board alleging that noel canning's actions constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of the nlra. an alj determined that the agreement was binding and ordered noel canning to sign the collective bargaining agreement. the board affirmed the ruling against noel canning.
noel canning appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, which held that the board's ruling was invalid because not enough members of the board were present. the panel that heard the noel canning case consisted of one member who was appointed by president barack obama and confirmed by the senate in 2010 and two members whom president obama appointed without senate confirmation in january 2012. although the recess appointments clause allows the president to fill vacancies that occur while congress is in recess, between december 2011 and the end of january 2012, the senate met in pro forma meetings every three business days. therefore, the court of appeals determined that the senate was not in recess on the days the senate did not meet because, for the purpose of the recess appointments clause, recess is defined as the time in between sessions of congress."

the seized books were paper-bound “pulps,” and most had jackets with illustrations relating to the fictional subject matter within. the covers of nineteen of the books displayed illustrations of women being whipped, beaten, tortured or abused. most of the book jackets depicted symbols associated with fetishism, such as leather boots, excessively tight clothing, black gloves, whips, masks and corsets. some presented incidents of sexual seduction, transvestism, sodomy, rape and masturbation.
the state of new york charged mishkin with multiple counts of  possessing obscene books, of hiring others to prepare obscene books, and of publishing obscene books. at trial, authors who worked under mishkin for several years testified that he instructed them to fill the books with strong sexual material. mishkin was convicted before a three-judge panel of the court of special sessions. he was sentenced to a three-year prison term and ordered to pay $12,000 in fines. the appellate court affirmed mishkin’s sentence, modifying the judgment to remove charges related to mishkin’s failure to print the name and address of the publisher or printer on the books; the court held the statute requiring this action to be unconstitutional. the court of appeals of new york affirmed the judgment, holding that the new york law forbidding obscene material itself did not violate mishkin’s constitutional rights and was not unconstitutionally vague."

brumfield next filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court and argued that the state courts had erred in failing to give him a full atkins hearing. he also requested funding to enable him to fully present his claims, which was granted. a federal magistrate found that, while the state court had correctly ruled that brumfield's initial evidence regarding his mental retardation was not adequate for the court to have granted atkins relief, the additional funds enabled brumfield to establish a prima facie case of mental retardation. the federal magistrate subsequently recommended that the district court admit brumfield's new evidence when determining his habeas claim; the district court did so and ruled in favor of brumfield by forbidding louisiana from executing him. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed and held that the state court's ruling on brumfield's atkins claim constituted a decision on the merits, so the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act prevented the district court from reviewing the decision unless the state court's decision was contrary to clearly established federal law or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. because the state denied brumfield additional funds to develop his case due to his failure to establish a prima facie case of mental retardation, the decision was not a violation of brumfield's constitutional due process rights nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts."

zang and lawson each filed separate actions against their former employers in district court. they alleged that the defendants violated ""whistleblower"" protection sections of the sarbanes-oakley act by taking retaliatory actions against them. the district court found in favor of the plaintiffs and held that the whistleblower provisions extended to employees of private agents, contractors, and subcontractors to public companies and that the plaintiffs had engaged in protected activity under the statute. the defendants appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit, which reversed the decision. looking at both congressional intent and the plain meaning of the statute, the court of appeals held that the plaintiffs were not protected employees under the act."

in response to demands by the california attorney general that they file the lists, the organizations filed a lawsuit alleging that the filing requirement unconstitutionally burdened their first amendment right to free association by deterring individuals from financially supporting them. the organizations provided evidence that although the state is required to keep donor names private, the state’s database was vulnerable to hacking, and many donor names were repeatedly released to the public. based in part on this finding, the district court granted both organizations’ motions for a preliminary injunction and then ultimately found for them after a trial, holding that the organizations and their donors were entitled to first amendment protection under the principles established in the supreme court’s decision in naacp v. alabama. in so holding, the court reasoned that the government’s filing demands were not the “least restrictive means” of obtaining the information and thus did not satisfy “strict scrutiny.”
a panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed, based on its conclusion that “exacting scrutiny” rather than “strict scrutiny” was the appropriate standard, and “exacting scrutiny” requires that the government show that the disclosure and reporting requirements are justified by a compelling government interest and that the legislation is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.

at trial, a jury found in favor of ms. williams and awarded her $79.5 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $32 million. on appeal, philip morris argued that the trial court had committed an error when it failed to give a proposed jury instruction stating, in part, that the jury should not ""punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons."" the case eventually wound up before the oregon supreme court (""osc""), which ruled that the proposed jury instruction incorrectly stated the federal requirements of due process of law, and the trial court was therefore correct to exclude it. the osc found it unnecessary to rule, at that time, on whether the jury instruction was flawed for its description of state-law requirements. philip morris sought and was granted certiorari to the u.s. supreme court. the court reversed the osc, stating that due process did not necessarily require exclusion of the instruction, and remanded the case so that the osc could apply the correct standard.
on remand, the osc stated that the u.s. supreme court's new constitutional standard was only triggered ""upon request,"" which obligated it to determine whether philip morris's request was valid under state law. the osc held that the proposed instruction misstated oregon's statutory punitive damages criteria and therefore was not ""clear and correct in all respects,"" as it must be to be considered error. the u.s. supreme court, which will now hear the case for the second time after granting philip morris' certiorari petition, must determine whether the osc is permitted to insert these state law issues at such a late stage in the game."

home oil then transferred its assets to home concrete as a capital contribution. the taxpayers (except home oil) then transferred percentages of their partnership interests in home concrete to home oil as capital contributions. home concrete then sold substantially all of its assets to a third party purchaser for $10,623,348. the taxpayers timely filed their tax returns for 1999 in april 2000. home concrete elected to step-up its inside basis, or the amount that the partnership tax records compute for each partner, to equal the taxpayers' outside basis. home concrete again adjusted its inside basis to $10,527,250.53, including the amount of short sale proceeds earlier contributed by the taxpayers. as a result home concrete reported a $69,125.08 gain from the sale of its assets.
the irs did not investigate until june 2003. as a result of their investigation, the irs determined that the partnership was formed ""solely for the purposes of tax avoidance by artificially overstating basis in the partnership interests of its purported partners."" on september 7, 2006 the irs issued a final partnership administrative adjustment (fpaa), in which they decreased to zero the taxpayers' reported outside bases in home concrete. this substantially increased the taxpayers' taxable income. plaintiff taxpayers brought action against internal revenue service (irs) seeking to recover the increase.
as a general matter, the internal revenue service (irs) has three years to assess additional tax if the agency believes that the taxpayer's return has understated the amount of tax owed. that period is extended to six years, however, if the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the taxpayer's return. during the trial the treasury department passed a regulation stating that the six-year period for assessing tax remains open for ""all taxable years... that are the subject of any case pending before any court of competent jurisdiction... in which a decision had not become final."" the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit disagreed and found in favor of the plaintiffs."

in 2003, the two parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a trademark dispute in which lucky brand agreed not to use “get lucky” and marcel agreed to release certain claims it might have in the future arising out of its trademarks. the two parties contest the scope of marcel’s release of claims, with marcel contending that it only released claims as to infringement that occurred prior to the 2003 execution of the agreement and lucky brand arguing that it released any future claim marcel may have in relation to any trademark registered prior to the execution of the agreement. further litigation ensued.
in litigation between the two parties over substantially the same trademark disputes, lucky brand argued for its interpretation of the 2003 settlement agreement. it moved to dismiss on the basis that because the marks at issue were registered prior to the settlement agreement, marcel released any claim alleging infringement of those marks. the district court denied the motion, concluding that it was premature to determine which claims were subject to release in the 2001 agreement. however, the district court noted that lucky brand was “free to raise the issue . . . again after the record is more fully developed.” lucky brand raised the defense again in its answer and as an affirmative defense, but not again during the litigation. after a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for marcel, declaring that lucky brand infringed on marcel’s “get lucky” trademark and enjoining lucky brand from using the “get lucky” mark. lucky brand did not appeal.
in 2011, marcel filed another lawsuit against lucky brand alleging that the latter continued to use “lucky brand” mark after the injunction. lucky brand moved for summary judgment on the basis that marcel’s claims were precluded by res judicata in light of the final disposition of the previous action. the district court agreed, but the second circuit reversed, finding the allegedly barred claims “could not possibly have been sued upon in the previous case.” on remand, marcel filed a second amended complaint, which lucky brand moved to dismiss on the sole basis that the 2001 agreement barred marcel’s claims. the district court granted the motion and rejected marcel’s argument that lucky brand was precluded from raising those claims.

the district court ruled in favor of duke. the judge refused to rely on the epa's current interpretation, ruling that it was inconsistent with the wording of the psd regulations. environmental defense appealed to the fourth circuit court of appeals, and the circuit court affirmed the district court's decision. the fourth circuit pointed out that the 1977 psd amendment had taken its definition of ""modification"" directly from a 1975 clean air act amendment concerning the new source performance standards program (nsps). in the 1975 amendment, the term ""modification"" explicitly excluded improvements that merely increase the hours of operation of a facility. therefore, the fourth circuit held, the epa did not have statutory authority to interpret ""modification"" differently for the psd program. environmental defense appealed to the supreme court, with the added argument that the fourth circuit never should have heard the case, because challenges to clean air act regulations can only be brought in the d.c. cricuit."

williams then asked mccarty whether he had been using intoxicants, and mccarty responded that he had consumed two beers and smoked several joints of marijuana a short time before. williams placed mccarty under arrest. at the county jail, however, a breathalyzer test did not detect any alcohol in mccarty’s system. williams resumed questioning mccarty, asking him if he was under the influence of alcohol and whether the marijuana had been treated with any chemicals. williams responded, “i guess, barely,” to the first question, but denied that the marijuana he smoked had been treated. at no point did williams or any other officer tell mccarty that he had a right to remain silent, to consult with an attorney, or to have an attorney appointed for him if he could not afford one.
mccarty was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, a first-degree misdemeanor under ohio law punishable by fine or imprisonment for up to six months. mccarty moved to exclude the incriminating statements he made to trooper williams both on the scene of the arrest and in jail, on the grounds that he had not been informed of his constitutional rights prior to interrogation. the trial court denied the motion; mccarty pled ‘no contest’ and was found guilty. on appeal, the franklin county court of appeals held that the miranda rule does not apply to misdemeanors, relying on a prior decision by the supreme court of ohio. the supreme court of ohio dismissed mccarty’s appeal for failing to present a substantial constitutional question. the district court for the southern district of ohio dismissed mccarty’s writ of habeas corpus, but the united states court of appeals sixth circuit reversed. it held that miranda warnings must be given to all individuals accused of misdemeanor traffic offenses prior to custodial interrogation, but did not clearly apply this rule to mccarty’s statements made at the scene of his arrest."

the federal circuit, sitting en banc, held that it does apply. the court rejected the argument that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice restores the parties to their positions as though no legal proceedings had ever begun, concluding instead that a defendant served with a complaint remains “served” even if the civil action is voluntarily dismissed without prejudice and thus does such a dismissal does not toll the statute of limitations.

the eleventh circuit also rejected lozman’s challenge to the district court’s instruction on retaliatory animus, stating that any error the instruction may have contained was harmless because the jury’s probable cause finding defeated lozman’s retaliatory arrest claim as a matter of law. the appeals court also rejected lozman’s challenge to the lower court’s jury instructions regarding the city’s authority to limit public comment during city council meetings. the supreme court’s grant of certiorari did not include these two issues."

the dispute centered on the degree of control exercised by the ftc over philip morris. the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling in favor of philip morris, allowing the case to continue in the federal court system. the eighth circuit held that the question of whether 28 u.s.c. 1442(a)(1) applies ""depends on the detail and specificity of the federal direction of the defendant's activities and whether the government exercises control over the defendant."" in the case of the tobacco industry, the eighth circuit found ""unprecedented"" government involvement, including detailed ftc regulations concerning the testing and disclosure of tar and nicotine levels. therefore, philip morris was ""acting under a federal officer"" and consequently entitled to remove the case to federal court."

in 2011 the cases were consolidated as a multi-district litigation action in the u.s. district court for the district of new jersey. the cases subsequently grew to include over 1,000 plaintiffs. after discovery and a bellwether trial, the district court ruled in favor of merck on a summary judgment motion, dismissing all of the plaintiffs’ claims on the basis that they were preempted by federal law under wyeth v. levine, 555 u.s. 555 (2009), which held that state-law failure-to-warn claims are preempted in the event that there is “clear evidence” that the fda would not have approved the warning that a plaintiff claims was necessary.
the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit vacated and remanded the district court’s ruling, holding that preemption was an affirmative defense, and that merck had not sufficiently proven that it was entitled to that defense as a matter of law. under wyeth’s demanding “clear evidence” standard, the appellate court found that the plaintiffs had produced adequate evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the fda would have approved an appropriately worded warning about the risk of femur fractures, or at least that the chances of fda rejection were not highly probable. pursuant to wyeth and federal rule of civil procedure 56, this showing was sufficient to defeat summary judgment and move forward to trial."

the district court dismissed the suit, holding that fsia's treaty exception grants the hungarian defendants immunity, that the 1947 peace treaty between the allied powers and hungary set forth an exclusive mechanism for hungarian holocaust victims to obtain recovery for their property losses, and that permitting the plaintiffs' lawsuit to proceed under fsia would conflict with the peace treaty's terms. the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit affirmed the dismissal as to the non-property claims and reversed as to the property-based claims. the court remanded the case for the district court to determine whether, as a matter of international comity, it should refrain from exercising jurisdiction over those claims until the plaintiffs exhaust domestic remedies in hungary.
on remand, the district court again dismissed the case, holding that international comity required that the plaintiffs first exhaust their claims in hungary. again, the d.c. circuit reversed, noting that its intervening decision in philipp v. federal republic of germany (2018) “squarely rejected” the comity-based ground for declining to exercise jurisdiction."

241	in july 1976, ohio charged petitioners, officers of hustler magazine, with disseminating obscene materials for their role in publishing an issue of hustler that contained a political cartoon that ohio deemed obscene. the trial court dismissed the charge and held that ohio violated the petitioners’ rights under the equal protection clause by engaging in discriminatory prosecution. ohio appealed to the court of appeals of ohio for the eighth district, which reversed the trial court’s decision and reinstated the charges. petitioners appealed to the supreme court of ohio and argued that ohio’s decision to prosecute hustler, instead of other magazines that routinely published similar content, was discriminatory. the supreme court of ohio ruled that petitioners did not establish the elements for a prima facie case for unconstitutional discriminatory prosecution. to do so, petitioners had to show that they were singled out for prosecution while there were other magazines similarly situated that were not prosecuted, and that the government’s decision to prosecute them was made in bad faith, based upon race, religion, or the desire to prevent their exercise of first amendment rights. the supreme court of ohio determined the petitioners had not met this burden and remanded the case to the lower courts so that the petitioners could present further evidence to meet this burden.

the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit disagreed and affirmed the district court. it held that the deprivation of honest services owed to an employer is not mitigated simply because the inducement was a tax benefit obtained from a third party. the court reasoned that had the defendants disclosed to hollinger's audit committee and board of directors that the compensation was meant to bring about tax benefits, the committee and board very well may have reduced the pay-out in light of the tax benefits."

on appeal, the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed and held that james's drug-trafficking offense was serious. the eleventh circuit agreed with the district court that attempted burglary counted as a violent felony, a ruling that put it at odds with other circuits. the circuit court ruled that attempted burglary is a violent felony because it presents as much risk of violence as a successful burglary."

in 1970, beaty mae gilliard, who had been receiving benefits from north carolina through the afdc since 1962, gave birth to her seventh child. because gilliard was receiving child support from the child’s father, the state deducted the child support from the benefits she was eligible for as the parent of an eight-person family. gilliard sued, and the district court agreed with her reading of the statute that she was allowed to exclude the child who was receiving child support from her filing unit because the seven-person family benefits were greater than what she would receive from the eight-person family benefits minus the child support. the district court awarded class relief to anyone in gilliard’s position. when north carolina adopted regulations to comply with the 1984 act, gilliard and other members of the class filed a motion to reopen the case and obtain relief. the district court concluded that the new statutory scheme adopted by the 1984 act violated the due process and takings clause of the fifth amendment.

in 2008, each couple filed suit separately in state court. quicken removed the cases to a federal district court where the three cases were consolidated. quicken moved for summary judgment, claiming that the claims were not actionable under respa because the fees were not split with another party. the district court noted a circuit split on the issue of whether respa did not apply where fees were not spit with another party. nonetheless, the district court granted quicken's motion. the couples appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit, which affirmed the district court's opinion. the appealed the appeals court's opinion."

277	section 504 of the labor-management reporting and disclosure act (lmrda) of 1959 forbids any member of the communist party from serving as an executive officer of a labor union, with the goal of preventing politically-motivated strikes that would pose a danger to the national economy. archie brown, a san francisco longshoreman and admitted member of the communist party, was three times elected to the executive board of the local international longshoremen's and warehousemen's union from 1959 through 1961. on may 24, 1961, brown was charged with violating section 504 of the lmrda. no evidence was presented at trial suggesting that brown was involved in any other illegal activity or plotting a political strike. brown was found guilty and sentenced to six months in prison. the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit, sitting en banc, reversed the conviction and found that section 504 violated the first and fifth amendments of the constitution. in response to appeal by the united states to the supreme court, brown also argued that section 504 constitutes a bill of attainder, a law that targets a single individual or group, and therefore violates article i, section 9.

278	in 1992, the district court sentenced manuel d. peguero to 274 months of imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. during sentencing, the court did not inform peguero of his right to appeal the sentence. in 1996, in a later motion for habeas relief, peguero claimed that the court violated federal rule of criminal procedure 32(a)(2) by failing to advise him of his right to appeal. after an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that, although it failed to advise peguero of his right, he knew of his right when the sentencing hearing occurred. thus the court, rejecting peguero's claim that any violation of rule 32 is enough to vacate a sentence, held that he was not entitled to relief because he was aware of his right to appeal at the time of sentencing. in affirming, the court of appeals held that a rule 32 violation was subject to harmless-error review and concluded that the rule's purpose had been served since peguero was aware of his right to appeal.

the detective prepared an affidavit and applied for a search warrant, which was issued. a search confirmed that marijuana was being grown inside the home. jardines was arrested and charged with trafficking cannabis. jardines moved to suppress the evidence seized at his home on the theory that the drug dog's sniff was an impermissible search under the fourth amendment and that all subsequent evidence was fruit of the poisonous tree.
the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and subsequently ruled to suppress the evidence. the state appealed the suppression ruling and the state appellate court reversed, concluding that no illegal search had occurred since the officer had the right to go up to the defendant's front door and that a warrant was not necessary for the drug dog's sniff. the florida supreme court reversed the appellate court's decision and concluded that the dog's sniff was a substantial government intrusion into the sanctity of the home and constituted a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment. the state of florida appealed the florida supreme court's decision."

283	"donald zarda worked in 2010 as a sky-diving instructor at altitude express. part of his job was to participate in tandem skydives with clients, in which he was necessarily strapped in close proximity to the client. a gay man, zarda sometimes told female clients about his sexual orientation to address any concern they might have about being strapped to a man for a tandem skydive. on one occasion after zarda informed a female client about his sexual orientation and performed the tandem jump with her, the client alleged that zarda had inappropriately touched her and disclosed his sexual orientation to excuse his behavior. in response to this complaint, zarda's boss fired him. zarda denied touching the client inappropriately and claimed that he was fired solely because of his reference to his sexual orientation.
zarda filed a discrimination charge with the equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc) claiming that he was fired because of his sexual orientation and also because of he did not conform to male gender stereotypes. he brought a claim in federal court alleging, among other things, that altitude express violated title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 by terminating him because of his sexual orientation. the district court ruled for altitude express, finding that title vii does not protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation. after the district court's ruling, the eeoc issued an opinion in a separate case (persuasive but not binding on federal district courts) that title vii's “on the basis of sex” language necessarily includes discrimination “on the basis of sexual orientation.” in light of this decision, zarda moved for the district court to reinstate his title vii claim, but the district court denied the motion, citing binding second circuit precedent, simonton v. runyon, 232 f.3d 33 (2d cir. 2000), and dawson v. bumble &amp; bumble, 398 f.3d 211 (2d cir. 2005).

(the supreme court in u.s. v. booker had declared the sentencing guidelines to be merely advisory, but the guidelines range is still among the factors a court must consider before handing down a reasonable sentence.)
the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit rejected the below-guidelines sentence as unreasonable. the eighth circuit held that while the guidelines are not mandatory, sentences that fall outside of the recommended sentencing range must overcome a presumption of unreasonableness. sentences varying from the guidelines must be justified based on the circumstances of the case, and larger variances from the guidelines require correspondingly more compelling justifications. the eighth circuit ruled that the district court had erred by using gall's youth as a mitigating factor, by overweighing his rehabilitation, and by underweighing the seriousness of the crime. since the ""extraordinary variance"" was not justified by a finding of extraordinary circumstances, the eighth circuit ordered a new sentence."

the magistrate judge determined that settlement agreement was a ""hybrid"" agreement, in which patent and non-patent rights were inseparable, and that the supreme court decision in brulotte v. thys co. applied. in that case, the court ruled that, when patents are sold in return for a royalty payment, the purchaser was not obligated to continue these payments beyond the expiration date of the patents because doing so would over-compensate the seller of the patent and improperly extend the patent monopoly beyond the intended time limit. on recommendation of the magistrate, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of marvel and ruled that the settlement agreement transferred patent rights, but that it was unclear if non-patent rights were transferred. kimble appealed and argued that the settlement agreement transferred both patent and non-patent rights and that, while royalty payments ended for the patent, they did not end for the toy itself. the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the decision of the district court."

relying on the supreme court’s decision in coker v. georgia, 433 u.s. 584 (1977), which held that the eighth amendment prohibited a death sentence for rape of an adult woman, briggs argued on appeal that rape was not “punishable by death” and thus was subject to the five-year statute of limitations for non-capital crimes. the united states air force court of criminal appeals (afcca) rejected his challenge because briggs had not raised the statute of limitations claim at trial. the court therefore affirmed the finding and sentence of the judge below. briggs appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the armed forces. reviewing for plain error, the c.a.a.f. reversed the lower court, finding that the rules for courts-martial r.c.m. 907(b)(2)(b) requires the military judge to inform the accused of the right to assert the statute of limitations. as such, the court found that if the military judge had informed briggs of a possible statute of limitations defense, he would have sought dismissal."

306	"two undercover fbi agents mistakenly identified petitioner james king as a criminal suspect and approached him. the parties differed in their account of the facts as to whether the agents identified themselves as police officers, but king apparently perceived he was being mugged and resisted their attempts to restrain him. a violent fight ensued, in which the officers severely beat king until onlookers called 911 and local police arrived on the scene. the local police officers ordered bystanders to delete video footage of the altercation because the videos could reveal the identities of undercover fbi officers. king was taken to the hospital, where he received medical treatment and was discharged. on his discharge, police arrested him and took him to kent county jail, where he spent the weekend in jail before posting bail and visiting another hospital for further examination. prosecutors pursued charges, but a jury acquitted king of all charges.
king then filed a lawsuit against the united states and both fbi agents, alleging that the agents violated his clearly established fourth amendment rights by conducting an unreasonable seizure and by using excessive force. in general, the united states and its agents are immune from liability under the principle of sovereign immunity. the federal tort claims act (ftca) waives sovereign immunity in specific situations, and the plaintiff bringing an ftca claim bears the burden of showing his claim falls within such situations. the ftca also contains a “judgment bar” provision that precludes a plaintiff from bringing additional claims concerning the “same subject matter” as an ftca claim after a judgment is entered on the ftca claim.
the district court found that king failed to prove one of the six requirements for ftca to apply, and therefore that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to hear king’s claim against the united states. the court further held that the defendant agents were entitled to qualified immunity and granted summary judgment in their favor. the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed, finding the ftca judgment bar does not preclude king’s remaining claims because the court did not reach the merits of the ftca claims and that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.

espinoza and the other mothers filed a lawsuit in state court challenging rule 1. the court determined that the scholarship program was constitutional without rule 1 and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. on appeal, the department of revenue argued that the program is unconstitutional without rule 1. the montana supreme court agreed with the department and reversed the lower court.

308	the contract disputes act of 1978 (cda) established rules governing disputes arising out of certain federal government contracts. after congress enacted the national parks omnibus management act of 1998, which established a comprehensive concession management program for national parks, the national park service (nps) issued 36 cfr section 51.3, which purported to render the cda inapplicable to concession contracts. the national park hospitality association challenged 51.3's validity. upholding the regulation, the district court concluded that the cda is ambiguous as to whether it applies to concession contracts and found the nps's interpretation reasonable. in affirming, the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit found the nps's reading of the cda consistent with both the cda and the national parks omnibus management act of 1998.

309	"anup engquist, a woman of indian descent, brought this action against the oregon department of agriculture alleging that a co-worker at the department harassed her and eventually engineered her termination. although engquist asserted numerous claims, a jury in the federal district court only found in her favor on her equal protection, substantive due process, and intentional interference with employment claims.
on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit struck those jury verdicts. although the ninth circuit acknowledged that the supreme court had previously dealt with such ""class of one"" equal protection claims eight years ago in a case, village of willowbrook v. olech, involving a village resident suing the village for unjustified zoning decisions, it refused to apply that short, two-page opinion to engquist's claim. the ninth circuit reasoned that the olech opinion may only apply when the government is in the role of regulator and did not clarify whether it would also apply in an employment context such as this one. in seeking court review, engquist noted the pervasive splits in the circuits regarding the proper allocation of the court's decision in olech, while oregon claimed that olech should be construed narrowly so as to avoid a deluge of petty cases against the government. oregon also pointed out that even if the case were to be heard, oregon would have qualified immunity and engquist would necessarily lose."

the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the board. the court held that the nlrb had power to delegate its authority to a group of three of its members. in which case, two sitting members constituted a quorum. therefore, the nlrb appropriately rendered its decision."

the district court rejected weyerhaeuser's motion, ruling that brooke group applies only to predatory pricing, where a company prices its products too low in order force competitors out of the market, and not to predatory buying. under the less stringent guidelines, the jury found weyerhaeuser to be in violation of the sherman act, and awarded ross-simmons $78.8 million in damages. on appeal, the ninth circuit court of appeals upheld the district court, ruling that the higher standard of liability for predatory pricing compared to predatory buying is appropriate, because business practices that resemble predatory pricing may result in benefits such as efficiency incentives and lower prices for consumers."

williams appealed, claiming that the trial court abused its discretion when it removed juror number six, because the removal of the ""lone holdout"" juror violated williams' sixth amendment right to a unanimous jury. the california court of appeals rejected her claim as meritless, and the california supreme court denied further direct appellate review.
williams filed a state habeas corpus petition in los angleles county superior court. the court denied the petition, ruling that the issues raised in the petition were issues for direct appeal, not collateral attack. williams next filed a federal habeas corpus petition, in which she again challenged the removal of juror number six. the magistrate judge concluded that the trial court's factual finding of bias was entitled to deference and that the discharge of juror number six did not constitute a constitutional violation. the district court adopted the report of the magistrate judge and dismissed the petition with prejudice.
williams appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit. the appellate court reversed the district court, holding that the deferential-review standard did not apply because the california court of appeal had only reviewed her state claim and had not adjudicated her federal constitutional claim. the appellate court then conducted a review of williams' federal claim and concluded that the sixth amendment does not allow a trial judge to discharge a juror on account of his views on the merits of the case. the state of california appealed to the appellate court's decision."

342	"the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) was investigating seila law llc, a law firm that provides debt-relief services, among others. as part of its investigation, the cfpb issued a civil investigative demand to seila law that requires the firm to respond to several interrogatories and requests for documents. seila law refused to comply with the demand, so the cfpb filed a petition in the district court to enforce compliance. the district court granted the petition and ordered seila law to comply with the cid. seila law appealed the district court’s order on two grounds, one of which was that the cfpb is unconstitutionally structured.
specifically, seila law argued that the cfpb’s structure violates the constitution’s separation of powers because it is an independent agency headed by a single director who exercises substantial executive power but can be removed by the president only for cause. the ninth circuit disagreed.
the court found two supreme court decisions on separation of powers controlling: humphrey’s executor v. united states, 295 u.s. 602 (1935), and morrison v. olson, 487 u.s. 654 (1988). according to the ninth circuit panel, those cases indicate that the for-cause removal restriction protecting the cfpb’s director does not “impede the president’s ability to perform his constitutional duty” to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed.

upon its creation, fhfa placed fannie and freddie in a conservatorship with itself as the conservator and negotiated agreements with the department of treasury. under the agreements, the treasury would invest billions of dollars in the gses in return for compensation consisting in part of fixed dividends. for several years, the gses’ dividend obligations exceeded their total earnings, requiring them to draw even more money from the treasury. fhfa and treasury negotiated and came up with the “third amendment,” which replaced the fixed dividend with a variable quarterly dividend equal to the gses’ net worth minus a specified capital reserve.
collins and others are shareholders in fannie and freddie. they filed a lawsuit challenging the actions of fhfa, claiming the agency had destroyed the value of their ownership interests. the shareholders argued that fhfa had exceeded its authority under two federal statutes and that the structure of fhfa violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers. the district court dismissed the statutory claims and granted the government’s motion for summary judgment on the constitutional claim. a panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed the dismissal of the statutory claims but reversed the judgment as to the constitutional claim, finding that the structure of fhfa was unconstitutional but the remedy was to invalidate the provision addressing removal of fhfa’s director. in a deeply divided opinion, the fifth circuit, rehearing the case en banc, affirmed as to one statutory claim, reversed as to the other statutory claim, held that fhfa’s structure violated the constitution, and held that the appropriate remedy was to declare unconstitutional the removal provision, not to invalidate the third amendment."

the district court initially dismissed apcc's suit, but the court eventually reversed itself, concluding that it was sufficient that the assignment transferred legal title to the claim rather than merely transferring power of attorney. the u.s. court of appeals for the eight circuit affirmed, concluding that, as a matter of law, the assignment of a legal right to bring a claim gives the assignee a personal stake in the litigation sufficient to confer standing."

when donaldson was admitted in 1957, j.b. o’connor was assistant clinical director of the hospital; o’connor was also donaldson’s attending physician until he transferred wards on april 18, 1967. john gumanis was a staff physician for donaldson’s ward. donaldson was denied grounds privileges by gumanis and confined to a locked building with sixty closely-quartered beds. as a christian scientist, donaldson refused to take any medication or to submit to electroshock treatments. according to donaldson, he received cognitive therapy from o’connor no more than six times. in essence, the hospital provided donaldson with subsistence-level custodial care, and a minimal amount of psychiatric treatment. donaldson challenged his continued commitment several times, but each challenge was denied with little explanation.
in february 1971, donaldson charged o’connor and other members of the hospital’s staff under § 1983 with intentionally and maliciously depriving him of his constitutional right to liberty. evidence at trial showed that the staff had the power to release a mentally ill, committed patient if he was not dangerous to himself or others, but that the staff did not exercise this power. the jury trial found in favor of donaldson, assessing both compensatory and punitive damages against o’connor and gumanis. o’connor appealed his case separately, and the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit, affirmed the jury’s verdict. the court rejected o’connor’s argument that the trial court improperly barred the jury from finding that o’connor acted in good faith. the jury instruction was valid because it explicitly stated that the defendants’ reasonable belief that donaldson’s confinement was proper would preclude damages. any reliance on state law would fall under this consideration of o'connor's good faith intentions."

southern union objected. the company argued that the number of days that southern union illegally stored mercury was a fact that should have been determined by a jury, because it increased the maximum criminal penalty. as such, southern union believed that the imposition of the $38.1 million dollar fine was a violation of its rights to criminal due process under the fifth amendment and to a trial by jury under the sixth amendment.

487	on august 24, 1954, william link sued wabash railroad company over injuries he received when his car ran into a wabash railroad train at a crossing. after six years of motions, a pretrial hearing was set for october 12, 1960. on october 11, 1960, link’s attorney contacted the wabash railroad attorney to inform him that he was doing work in indianapolis and would miss a deposition that was set to happen before the hearing. the next morning, link’s lawyer called the courthouse to notify the judge that he was detained in indianapolis filing papers for a case before the iowa supreme court. he said he could not make it to court that day but was available both of the next two days. two hours after the pretrial was supposed to start, the court found that link’s lawyer had not provided a sufficient reason for missing the hearing and dismissed the case “for failure to prosecute the action.” the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit affirmed.

488	"alejandra tapia was convicted of bringing illegal aliens into the united states and of jumping bail after being charged with immigration crimes. following the jury trial, a judge on the u.s. district court for the southern district of california sentenced tapia to 51 months in prison, noting that one factor in giving her a longer sentence was to make sure she remained confined long enough to take part in a drug rehab program.
tapia appealed the sentence, arguing that the district court committed plain error by basing her sentence on speculation about whether and when she could enter and complete the bureau of prison's 500-hour drug abuse treatment program. but in april 2010, the u.s. court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed the lower court order."

489	"radlax gateway hotel, llc., owned the radisson hotel at the los angeles international airport as well as an adjacent parking structure. in november of 2007, radlax sought to expand the radisson hotel. it therefore obtained a $142 million construction loan from the longview ultra construction loan investment fund, for which amalgamated bank served as trustee and administrative agent.
after taking out the loan, radlax was eventually forced to file voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois. soon after, radlax embarked on a campaign to sell the radisson hotel and adjacent parking structure.
on june 4, 2010, radlax filed a joint chapter 11 plan, which proposed the auction of substantially all of its assets and the distribution of proceeds to various creditors. the debtors specified that no secured creditor would be permitted to credit bid at the sale. amalgamated bank objected to the proposed bid procedures on the grounds that a sale of its collateral, free of liens, required the debtor to allow a lender to credit bid.
the bankruptcy court agreed with amalgamated bank and denied radlax's proposal with regard to credit bids. the case was appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit, which affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision. radlax subsequently appealed the appellate court's decision."	False
490	"the state of washington, through its department of social and health services, provides foster care to certain children. it also receives and manages social security benefits, which it uses to cover its costs, for many of those children. such beneficiary children filed suit, alleging that the department's use of their benefits to reimburse itself for the foster care costs violated the ""anti-attachment"" provision of title ii of the social security act, which protects certain benefits from ""execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process."" the trial court enjoined the department from continuing to charge its foster care costs against social security benefits and ordered restitution of previous reimbursement transfers. the washington supreme court ultimately affirmed the trial court's holding that the department's practices violated the anti-attachment provision."

491	"the us supreme court issued a 2016 order granting certiorari in this patent infringement case, vacating a 2015 ruling by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit and remanding the matter for further consideration in light of , 579 u.s. __ (2016). on remand, the appellate court vacated the district court’s judgment for enhanced damages for willful infringement under 35 u.s.c. § 284, but reinstated its 2015 opinion in all other respects. 
the underlying dispute in the case related to patent-practicing devices sold by ion geophysical corporation (“ion”) which were combined and used in non-infringing streamer systems at sea, but that would infringe on patents belonging to westerngeco llc (“westerngeco”) if used in that manner in the us. the jury found infringement by ion, found no invalidity as to any asserted claims, and awarded westerngeco, among other amounts, $93.4 million in lost profits. 
in a subsequent appeal to the federal circuit, ion asked, among other things, that the lost profits award be reversed. in its 2015 opinion, the federal circuit agreed and reversed that award on the grounds that under 35 u.s.c. § 271(f), westerngeco was not entitled to lost profits arising from foreign uses of its patented invention. as stated above, the court then reinstated this portion of that opinion in 2016."
