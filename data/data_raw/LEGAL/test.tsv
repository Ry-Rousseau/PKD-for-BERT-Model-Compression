0	"on april 11, 2007, travis beckles was arrested because a sawed-off shotgun was located in his residence, and he had previous felony convictions, mostly for drug possession and sales. beckles was convicted, and during the sentencing phase of his trial, the district court determined that beckles was an armed career criminal under the armed career criminal act (acca) who had been in possession of a firearm and was therefore subject to sentencing enhancement under the sentencing guidelines. pursuant to the sentencing guidelines, beckles was eligible for a sentence range from 360 months to life imprisonment, and the court sentenced him to 360 months in prison, five months of supervised release, and a $5,000 fine. beckles appealed and argued that the sentencing guidelines imposed an unreasonable sentence, that his prior convictions did not qualify as “violent felonies” subject to sentencing enhancement under acca, and that possession of a sawed-off shotgun was not a “crime of violence” subject to sentencing enhancement under the sentencing guidelines. the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed beckles’ conviction and sentence.
the u.s. supreme court vacated the appellate court’s decision and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of johnson v. united states, which determined that the residual clause of acca was unconstitutional. on remand, the appellate court again upheld beckles’ conviction and sentence because possession of a sawed-off shotgun was a “crime of violence.” the appellate court also held that the johnson decision did not affect this case because beckles was not sentenced under the residual clause of acca but rather under express language from the sentencing guidelines about sentencing enhancements for crimes of violence."

1	"in october 1977, hughes anderson bagley was indicted on fifteen charges of violating federal narcotics and firearms statutes. the government’s two principal witnesses were james f. o’connor and donald e. mitchell, private security guards. between april and june 1977, they assisted the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms (“atf”) in conducting an undercover investigation of bagley. in response to a discovery request for information about any deals, promises or inducements made to o’connor or mitchell, the government produced only affidavits from each man stating that each spoke without any threats or rewards, or promises of reward. bagley waived his right to a jury trial. at trial, o’connor and mitchell testified about the firearms and narcotics charges. on december 23, 1977, the court found bagley guilty on the narcotics charges, but not the firearms charges.
in mid-1980, bagley filed requests pursuant to the freedom of information act and to the privacy act of 1974. he received copies of atf form contracts, each entitled, “contract for purchase of information and payment of lump sum therefor.” these contracts indicated that o’connor and mitchell provided information to the atf and promised a future payment of $300 to each informer. bagley moved to vacate his sentence under 28 u.s.c. § 2255, alleging that the government’s failure to disclose the contracts violated his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment.
the motion came before the same district judge who presided at bagley’s trial. at an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate found that neither informant expected payment for his testimony. in contrast, the district judge found that o’connor and mitchell probably expected to receive compensation for their assistance, and that the government suppressed evidence favorable to bagley. he also concluded, however, that the disclosure would not have had an effect on the court’s verdict. he emphasized that bagley’s counsel did not seek to discredit o’connor or mitchell on cross-examination. the united states court of appeals, ninth circuit, reversed, reasoning that the government’s failure to disclose required automatic reversal because it impaired bagley’s sixth amendment right to confront adverse witnesses through effective cross-examination."

3	"in 2012, the u.s. department of homeland security (dhs) adopted a program—known as the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca)—to postpone the deportation of undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the united states as children and to assign them work permits allowing them to obtain social security numbers, pay taxes, and become part of “mainstream” society in the united states.
in 2017, after the national election, when the trump administration replaced the obama administration, dhs began a phase-out of daca. the parties do not dispute the authority of a new administration to replace old policies with new policies, but the plaintiffs in this and related challenges allege that the new administration terminated daca based on a mistake of law rather than in compliance with the law. specifically, the trump administration terminated daca based on a conclusion that the obama administration had created daca “without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date” and thus that it was an “unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.”
the plaintiffs in this case and the related cases challenged this conclusion of law, alleging that the recission of daca violated the administrative procedure act because it was arbitrary and capricious, and because it was a substantive rule that did not comply with the apa’s notice-and-comment requirements. the challengers also alleged that the recission deprived daca recipients of constitutionally protected liberty and property interests without due process of law and violated the equal protection clause because it was motivated by discriminatory animus.
the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit rejected the government’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the daca recission was not “committed to agency discretion by law” and that there was “law to apply.” further, the ninth circuit granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction restoring daca, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to win on the merits of their arguments, they would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, the balance of equities tips in the plaintiffs’ favor, and the injunction is in the public interest."

4	in the mid-2000s, anthony perry began to develop osteoporosis, so in order to alleviate his pain and to ensure that he could continue working, he made an informal agreement with his supervisor at the u.s. census bureau. the deal allowed perry to take breaks throughout the day to control the symptoms of his osteoporosis, and to make up any time lost during the workday after hours with no penalty. on june 7, 2011, perry received a proposed removal notice that alleged that he had been paid for hours that he had not worked. he contested the charges and pointed to the informal agreement he and his supervisor had made and his unblemished performance record. in august 2011, perry and the agency entered into an agreement that required him to serve a thirty-day suspension, to retire on or before september 4, 2012, and to forfeit any discrimination claims against the agency. after serving his suspension and retiring, perry brought a pro se claim before the merit systems protection board, the federal board that is authorized the hear certain challenges by federal employees to adverse employment actions. an administrative law judge (alj) initially ruled that the board lacked jurisdiction because retirements are presumed to be voluntary, and the board cannot review claims that resulted in settlement with the agency. perry appealed to the board, which remanded the case. upon further review, the alj again denied that it had jurisdiction and held that perry had not sufficiently shown that he was improperly coerced into settling his claims. perry appealed to the board again, which affirmed the alj’s ruling. perry appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit, which transferred the case to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit based on a lack of proper jurisdiction.the appellate court docketed the case but granted perry’s motion to suspend proceedings until the u.s. supreme court resolves the jurisdictional issue of which court system should hear the case.

9	the federal power act (fpa) was passed in 1935 to regulate interstate electricity sales. the fpa vested the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) with authority over the transmission of electrical energy in interstate commerce and the wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce. to this end, ferc has created regional transmission organizations, such as pjm interconnection, llc, (pjm) which regulates a large regional market that includes maryland and the district of columbia. maryland became concerned that ferc actions were failing to adequately incentivize the construction of new plants, so the maryland public service commission began soliciting proposals for the construction of a new plant and instituted a generation order to regulate how the company that won the bid would interact with the rest of the energy market. commercial power ventures maryland, llc, (cpv) won the bid. ppl energyplus, llc, (ppl) and other existing power plants sued and argued that the generation order unconstitutionally interfered with the pjm-regulated market. the district court held that the generation order was preempted by the federal regulation of the energy markets pursuant to the supremacy clause. the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed. this case was consolidated with cpv’s suit against ppl and the other existing power plants.

section 502(a)(2) allows plan participants to sue plan administrators for breach of fiduciary duty in order to ""make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach."" dewolff argued that larue's suit was not of the type contemplated by the text of erisa because larue sued to recover losses caused to his own personal retirement plan rather than suing to vindicate the interests of the plan as a whole. larue also invoked section 502(a)(3), which allows plan participants to sue to obtain ""other appropriate equitable relief.""
the u.s. district court held that larue was not entitled to relief under erisa, and the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed. the fourth circuit ruled that section 502(a)(2) was concerned with protecting entire plans from misuse of plan assets and not with providing recovery for losses suffered by individual accounts. the court also rejected larue's section 502(a)(3) claim. it ruled that the phrase ""equitable relief"" rarely includes relief in the form of a monetary award and only when the money has been unjustly possessed by the defendant."

the bankruptcy appeals panel affirmed the court's ruling. on appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit, marrama argued that the plain language of section 706(a) of the bankruptcy code supported his right to convert to chapter 13, regardless of the circumstances. section 706(a) states, ""the debtor may convert a case under [chapter 7] to a case under chapter 11, 12 or 13 of this title at any time [...]"" citizens bank countered that the word ""may"" indicates a privilege rather than a right. it also argued that the bankruptcy system could be abused if debtors were able to convert to chapter 13 after filing bad faith chapter 7 petitions. the first circuit upheld the panel's ruling, denying marrama his conversion."

after government officials discovered the scheme but prior to indictment, robers pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud because the funds for the fraudulent loans were disbursed electronically (wired) by lenders. a federal district court sentenced him to three years of probation and ordered him to pay restitution pursuant to the mandatory victims restitution act (mvra) in the amount of $218,952.18 for both incidents. the amount was calculated by finding the difference between each loan and the resale amount of each house that was foreclosed (the offset value). robers appealed the restitution award and argued that the wrong offset value was used in the calculation; instead, the fair market price at the time of foreclosure should have been used. the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit affirmed the district court's holding in part, vacated attorney fees and ""other expenses"" from the restitution sum, and remanded the case back to the district court to draw a new order with the corrected sum."

after the plot was uncovered, the state court appointed youel smith as a special district attorney to lead the investigation and prosecution of those involved. mcdonough claimed that smith engaged in an elaborate scheme to frame mcdonough for the crimes. according to mcdonough, smith knew that mcdonough was innocent and fabricated evidence in the form of forged affidavits, false testimony, and faulty dna methods. after the first trial ended in a mistrial, the second trial ended in mcdonough’s acquittal on december 21, 2012.
on december 18, 2015, mcdonough filed a lawsuit under 42 u.s.c. § 1983 claiming that smith and the other defendants violated his due process rights by fabricating evidence and using it against him before a grand jury and in two trials. the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, claiming, among other things, that mcdonough’s claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the allegedly fabricated evidence had been disclosed to mcdonough over three years before he filed his section 1983 claim.
the district court granted the motions to dismiss as to mcdonough’s due process claims, citing the statute of limitations. the us court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed, finding that the precedent in that circuit established that the statute of limitations begins to run on a fabrication of evidence claim when the plaintiff has “reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.” the second circuit acknowledged that third, ninth, and tenth circuits have held otherwise but expressly disagreed with those decisions."

the federal district court rejected lawrence's habeas petition, because he had exceeded the one-year statute of limitations in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act (aedpa). the aedpa gives defendants one year to submit habeas petitions, but that does not include any time that the petitioner has a ""properly filed application"" pending for ""state post-conviction or other collateral review."" in lawrence's case, whether or not he had exceeded the one-year time limit depended on whether or not the time spent waiting for the supreme court to process his pending certiorari petition counted toward the time limit. federal circuit courts have disagreed on this question.
in his appeal, lawrence argued that time spent on supreme court certiorari petitions, like time spent on state-court appeals, was not countable toward the one-year statute of limitations. lawrence also made an alternative argument that the incompetence of his state-appointed counsel, as well as the disagreement among federal courts on the statute of limitations question, constituted ""extraordinary circumstances."" if the court were to find that the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the defendant's control, it could set aside the time limit under the doctrine of ""equitable tolling.""
the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit upheld the district court and rejected lawrence's petition. the circuit court ruled that lawrence had failed to demonstrate how his lawyer's actions or the confusion over the statute of limitations caused him to miss the deadline. the circuit court acknowledged that the statute of limitations had been in dispute, but it followed circuit precedent that said time spent waiting for a pending supreme court certiorari petition did count toward the aedpa's one-year time limit."

under the lanham act, marks must be “distinctive” to be eligible for protection, and generic terms are not distinctive. the uspto examiner rejected booking.com’s applications, finding that the marks were not protectable because booking.com was generic as applied to the services for which it sought registration (online hotel reservation services, among others).
the lanham act also allows protection for “descriptive” terms that have acquired secondary meaning, or a mental association in the minds of consumers between the proposed mark and the source of the product or service. in the alternative, the uspto concluded that the marks were merely descriptive and that booking.com had failed to establish that they had acquired secondary meaning as required for trademark protection.
booking.com appealed to the trademark trial and appeal board, which affirmed the rejection of booking.com’s applications. the board found that booking.com was a generic term for these types of services and therefore ineligible for trademark protection. because “booking” generically refers to “a reservation or arrangement to buy a travel ticket or stay in a hotel room” and “.com” indicates a commercial website, the board reasoned that consumers would understand the resulting term “booking.com” to refer to an online reservation service for travel—the very services proposed in booking.com’s applications. the district court reversed, ruling booking.com had acquired secondary meaning. a panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit the district court's reversal."

in 1991, when mckinney was 23, he and his half-brother michael hedlund committed two burglaries that resulted in two deaths. the state of arizona tried mckinney and hedlund before dual juries. mckinney’s jury found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder (without specifying whether it reached that verdict by finding premeditation or by finding felony murder), and hedlund’s jury found him guilty of one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder.
at mckinney’s capital sentencing hearing (before a judge), a psychologist testified that he had diagnosed mckinney with ptsd “resulting from the horrific childhood mckinney had suffered.” the psychologist further testified that witnessing violence could trigger mckinney’s childhood trauma and produce “diminished capacity.” the trial judge credited the psychologist’s testimony, but under arizona law at the time, the judge was prohibited from considering non-statutory mitigating evidence that the judge found to be unconnected to the crime. because mckinney’s ptsd was not connected to the burglaries, the judge could not consider it mitigating evidence and thus sentenced him to death.
the arizona supreme court affirmed mckinney’s death sentence on appeal. in 2003, mckinney filed a habeas petition in federal court. the district court denied relief, and a panel of the ninth circuit affirmed. the ninth circuit granted rehearing en banc and held that the arizona courts had violated the u.s. supreme court’s decision in eddings v. oklahoma, 455 u.s. 104 (1982), by refusing to consider mckinney’s ptsd. in eddings, the court held that a sentencer in a death penalty case may not refuse consider any relevant mitigating evidence. a violation of eddings, the ninth circuit held, required resentencing. thus, the ninth circuit remanded to the federal district court to either correct the constitutional error or vacate the sentence and impose a lesser sentence. arizona moved for independent review of mckinney’s sentence by the arizona supreme court; mckinney opposed the motion on the ground that he was entitled to resentencing by a jury under the u.s. supreme court’s decision in ring v. arizona, 536 u.s. 584 (2002), which held that juries, rather than judges, must make the findings necessary to impose the death penalty. the arizona supreme court disagreed, finding that mckinney was not entitled to resentencing by a jury because his case was ‘final’ before the u.s. supreme court issued its decision in ring."

(atlantic) built rocket motors for the united states government at an arkansas facility. when residue from burnt rocket fuel contaminated the site, atlantic voluntarily cleaned up the contamination and later sought cost recovery from the government under section 107(a) and section 113(f) of the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla). some courts of appeals had interpreted section 107(a) as implicitly allowing a party responsible for contamination to compel other partly-responsible parties to contribute to the clean-up. the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 added section 113(f), which makes explicit the right to sue for contribution.
while atlantic was negotiating with the government, the supreme court ruled in cooper industries, inc. v. aviall services, inc. that a party cannot bring a section 113(f) claim for contribution unless it is already the subject of a section 107(a) contamination action. atlantic filed a new claim for contribution under section 107(a), but a district court denied the claim. the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit had previously ruled that a liable party must use section 113(f), not section 107(a), to file a contribution claim. atlantic argued that failure to meet the requirements of section 113(f) did not foreclose the implied section 107(a) right to sue other partly-responsible parties for contribution."

73	mary ann sause, representing herself, filed a lawsuit under 42 u.s.c. § 1983 against members of the louisburg, kansas, police department, as well as the current and former mayor of the town. in her complaint she alleges that two police officers visited her apartment in response to a noise complaint, entered her apartment without consent, and “then proceeded to engage in a course of strange and abusive conduct.” she further alleges that at one point she “knelt and began to pray but one of the officers ordered her to stop.” sause claims that the officers’ conduct violated her first amendment right to the free exercise of religion and her fourth amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. the defendants moved to dismiss sause’s claim for failure to state a claim, asserting that they were entitled to qualified immunity. the district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint. on appeal, sause—now with counsel—argued only that her free exercise rights were violated by the officers’ conduct (dropping her fourth amendment claims). the tenth circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the action, concluding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.

74	"the equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc) received a complaint from a woman who claimed mach mining, llc (mach mining) denied her a job because of her gender. the eeoc determined that there was reasonable cause to believe mach mining had discriminated against female applicants and began conciliation, but the parties ultimately could not agree and the eeoc sued on the female applicants' behalf. mach mining argued that the eeoc did not conciliate in good faith, and the eeoc moved for summary judgment on whether failure to conciliate in good faith is a viable defense to its suit for unlawful discrimination. the district court denied the motion and held that courts may review the eeoc's informal settlement efforts to determine whether the eeoc made a sincere and reasonable effort to negotiate.
nonetheless, the court certified the question to the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit. the appellate court reversed and held that, so long as the eeoc has pleaded that it complied with title vii and the relevant documents are facially sufficient, judicial review is satisfied. the appellate court noted that title vii gives the eeoc complete discretion to accept or reject settlement offers during informal conciliation and provides no standard to evaluate the failure-to-conciliate affirmative defense. therefore, the appellate court determined that allowing an employer to use failure-to-conciliate as an affirmative defense would protract and complicate employment discrimination cases."

75	"los angeles county deputy sheriff curt messerschmidt prepared an affidavit in support of a search warrant for the residence of jerry bowen's foster mother. bowen was suspected of assaulting his former girlfriend with a sawed-off shotgun. the affidavit requested a night search because bowen had gang ties, so that a surprise search at night would be safer for the community and the personnel serving the search warrant. the warrant was reviewed by a sergeant, a police lieutenant and a deputy district attorney before it was presented to, and signed by, a judge. officers executed the warrant in the early morning hours. the homeowner, augusta millender, and her family responded by filing suit under for alleged violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments, for conspiracy to deprive them of their civil rights based on race, and for related state-law claims.
the district court found the warrant valid, messerchmidt's conduct reasonable and that probable cause existed to believe that bowen was at the residence and that nighttime service was appropriate. as to the scope of the warrant, however, the district court found it overbroad. on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit vacated the district court order and remanded the action with directions. the court held that law enforcement officers were entitled to qualified immunity where they reasonably relied on a deputy attorney general and a judge to restrict an overbroad search warrant's scope to items supported by probable cause."

76	"generally, wireless phone service providers must obtain zoning approvals from state and local governments before building wireless towers or attaching wireless equipment to buildings. to speed up the process, congress amended the 1934 communications act and required local governments to respond to zoning requests within a reasonable period of time. despite this law, the zoning approval process still dragged on and severely delayed construction. in 2008, the wireless association petitioned the federal communications commission (""fcc"") to bring an end to these unreasonable delays. the association recommended placing time limits on how long these zoning requests could take. the fcc agreed and in november 2009 set the following ""reasonable time"" limits for zoning requests: 90 days for attachments to current buildings and a 150 days for new structures.
the local governments claimed that the fcc cannot set these limits because the fcc cannot determine its own power under the communications act. when congress passed the act, it granted a certain amount of power to the fcc to enforce and define the rules under the act. under the long-standing chevron doctrine of interpretation, courts should always defer to an agency's interpretation of a particular act. however, the supreme court had never determined whether this applies to situations where the agency defines its own power under a particular law. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit nevertheless deferred to the fcc and affirmed the declaratory ruling. the local governments appealed to the supreme court, which granted certiorari exclusively to answer whether the chevron doctrine applies in this situation."

william armstrong iii was convicted of assaulting his wife in violation of maine’s misdemeanor domestic violence assault statutes in 2002 and 2008. in 2010, police searched the armstrong residence for drugs and drug paraphernalia and discovered ammunition which was later linked to guns armstrong had transported to a friend’s house. armstrong was also charged with violating the federal statute that makes it a crime for a person convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to possess a firearm.
voisine and armstrong moved to dismiss the charges against them and argued that maine’s misdemeanor domestic violence assault statutes do not constitute misdemeanor domestic violence under the federal statute because “recklessness” is sufficient for conviction under the maine statute, but not the federal one. the district court denied the motions, and the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed. the defendants petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the u.s. supreme court, which remanded the case in light of that court’s decision in united states v. castleman, which held that offensive touching satisfied the “physical force” requirement of the federal statute. on remand, the appellate court again held that maine’s statute constituted misdemeanor domestic violence under the federal statute."

80	"since it was ceded to the united states in 1898, puerto rico has accumulated substantial debt, in large part due to its ambiguous legal status as a protectorate of the united states and the economically detrimental policies the united states has enacted over the decades. exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, puerto rico’s debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the commonwealth was in a “death spiral” and was unable to pay its debt. in june 2016, president barack obama signed into law the puerto rico oversight, management and economic stability act of 2016 (promesa), which gave him authority to appoint a seven-member financial oversight and management board that would have control over puerto rico’s budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. president obama appointed the seven-member board in august 2016 based on lists supplied by republic and democratic lawmakers.
a number of creditors and elected officials of puerto rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging president obama’s authority to appoint the board members. the challengers alleged that the appointments clause of the u.s. constitution requires that the senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scope of this clause. the federal district court in puerto rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the commonwealth government established pursuant to congress’s plenary powers under the territorial clause and that the board members are not “officers of the united states.”
the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit reversed, concluding that the territorial clause does not supersede the application of the appointments clause in an unincorporated territory and that the board members are “officers of the united states” because: (1) they occupy “continuing positions,” (2) exercise “significant authority” that is the same or more than that exercised by other officers the u.s. supreme court has found to be “officers of the united states,” and (3) exercise their authority “pursuant to the laws of the united states.” moreover, these officers are “principal” officers subject to the appointments clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the president and are not directed or supervised by others who were appointed by the president with senate confirmation."

108	"in 2003, congress passed and the president signed the partial-birth abortion ban act. the controversial concept of partial-birth abortion is defined in the act as any abortion in which the death of the fetus occurs when ""the entire fetal head [...] or [...] any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother."" dr. leroy carhart and other physicians who perform late-term abortions sued to stop the act from going into effect. the plaintiffs argued that the act could apply to a more common abortion procedure known as ""d&amp;e"" (""dilation and evacuation""), as well as to the less common ""intact d&amp;e,"" sometimes called d&amp;x (""dilation and extraction""). with this application the act would ban most late-term abortions and thus be an unconstitutional ""undue burden"" on the right to an abortion, as defined by the supreme court in planned parenthood v. casey. the plaintiffs also argued that the act's lack of an exception for abortions necessary to protect the health of the mother rendered it unconstitutional under the supreme court's decision in stenberg v. carhart, regardless of congress's finding in the act that partial-birth abortions are never medically necessary.
a federal district court agreed and ruled the act unconstitutional on both grounds. the government appealed to the court of appeals for the eighth circuit. the government argued that the act only bans a narrow category of abortion procedures, and that a health exception is not required when congress determines that a banned abortion procedure is never necessary for the health of the mother. the eighth circuit disagreed and upheld the district court, ruling that a health exception is required for all bans on abortion procedures when ""substantial medical authority"" supports the necessity of the procedure. the circuit court ruled that the ongoing disagreement among medical experts over the necessity of intact d&amp;e abortions was sufficient to establish that the act was unconstitutional without a health exception. the circuit court did not reach the question of whether the act was so broad as to qualify as an unconstitutional ""undue burden."""

in his third appearance before the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit, cone raised two main points of contention. first, he claimed that he was entitled to relief because the jury in his trial had weighed invalid aggravating factors during his sentencing hearing, thereby entitling him to a new hearing. this argument was rejected by the sixth circuit, which found that the tennessee supreme court had conducted a satisfactory harmless error test on the issue. the court pointed out that habeas petitions should be granted only after finding that a state court ruling has ""resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law."" because tennessee had not abridged any federal laws, the sixth circuit denied cone relief on this first issue.
cone also argued that the sixth circuit had erred when, in a previous appeal, it had held that his claims relating to the prosecutor's improper withholding of evidence had been procedurally defaulted. cone argued that his case met the court's ""exceptional circumstances"" test as set out in westside mothers v. olszewski for overruling the procedural default rule and rehearing the issue. the sixth circuit once again disagreed, ruling that cone had failed to show ""cause and prejudice"" on the part of the prosecutor. the sixth circuit denied cone's habeas appeal on all counts."

s.e. appealed to the u.s. court of appeals, 9th circuit, challenging the mandate to register as a sex offender. in may 2008, s.e. turned 21, and the order to register expired. over a year later, judge stephen reinhardt, writing for a unanimous court, held that sorna was invalid on its face because the constitution forbids laws that are enforced retroactively. the supreme court, in a per curiam opinion, asked the montana supreme court to decide whether the question presented was moot because the district court's order had expired. justice jim rice, writing for the court with two dissents, held that s.e. was obligated to register under the montana sexual or violent offender registration act (""msvora""). hence, as montana law required s.e. to register, and this registration was not contingent on the 9th circuit's decision, the federal question was moot."

after a hearing, the magistrate judge held (1) the arbitration clause manifested an intent to have an arbitrator decide questions of arbitrability; (2) there is a reasonable construction of the arbitration clause that would call for arbitration in this dispute; and (3) the standard for determining whether equitable estoppel is appropriate requires arbitration against both signatories and non-signatories to the dealer agreement.
the district court vacated the magistrate judge’s order and held that the court could decide the question of arbitrability, and that the dispute was not arbitrable because the plain language of the arbitration clause expressly excluded suits that involved requests for injunctive relief. the court declined to reach the question of equitable estoppel. schein appealed to the fifth circuit.
in the fifth circuit, courts must look first to whether the parties “clearly and unmistakably” intended to delegate the question of arbitrability to an arbitrator. if they did, “the motion to compel arbitration should be granted in almost all cases,” except where “the argument that the claim at hand is within the scope of the arbitration agreement is ‘wholly groundless.’” this standard requires consideration of whether there is a plausible argument for the arbitrability of the dispute. if there is no such plausible argument, “the district court may decide the ‘gateway’ issue of arbitrability despite a valid delegation clause.’”

the respondents sued mullenix under 42 u.s.c. §1983 and argued that mullenix had violated leija’s fourth amendment rights by using excessive force against him. mullenix moved for summary judgment and argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity. the district court denied the motion and held that there were genuine questions of fact regarding whether mullenix acted as a reasonable officer would have under similar circumstances. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed and subsequently denied mullenix’s petition for a rehearing."

edith windsor is the widow and sole executor of the estate of her late spouse, thea clara spyer, who died in 2009. the two were married in toronto, canada, in 2007, and their marriage was recognized by new york state law. thea spyer left her estate to her spouse, and because their marriage was not recognized by federal law, the government imposed $363,000 in taxes. had their marriage been recognized, the estate would have qualified for a marital exemption, and no taxes would have been imposed.
on november 9, 2010 windsor filed suit in district court seeking a declaration that the defense of marriage act was unconstitutional. at the time the suit was filed, the government's position was that doma must be defended. on february 23, 2011, the president and the attorney general announced that they would not defend doma. on april 18, 2011, the bipartisan legal advisory group of the house of representatives filed a petition to intervene in defense of doma and motioned to dismiss the case. the district court denied the motion, and later held that doma was unconstitutional. the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed."

mitchell was charged with operating while intoxicated and with a prohibited alcohol concentration. he moved to suppress the results of the blood test on the ground that his blood was taken without a warrant and in the absence of any exceptions to the warrant requirement. the state argued that under the implied-consent statute, police did not need a warrant to draw his blood. many states, including wisconsin, have implied consent laws, which provide that by driving a vehicle, motorists consent to submit to chemical tests of breath, blood, or urine to determine alcohol or drug content. the trial court sided with the state and allowed the results of the blood test into evidence. mitchell was convicted on both counts.
mitchell appealed his conviction, and the court of appeals certified the case to the supreme court of wisconsin with respect to the issue “whether the warrantless blood draw of an unconscious motorist pursuant to wisconsin’s implied consent law...violates the fourth amendment.” the supreme court of wisconsin accepted the certification and upheld the search 5–2, but without any majority for the rationale for upholding it."

following denial, a claimant has six months to file suit or the suit is permanently barred. wong filed a claim with the ins and, following the denial of that claim, sought leave from the district court to add a civil claim against the u.s. to her already outstanding suit against a number of federal officials. for unexplained reasons, the district court did not allow wong to amend her complaint until seven months later, after the six-month deadline had passed. the district court then dismissed wong’s federal civil complaint and held that the six-month deadline was “jurisdictional” and thus not subject to equitable tolling, or delaying the time at which a statute of limitations begins to run. the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed and found that equitable tolling could be applied to the six-month deadline.
this case was consolidated with united states v. june, a case in which the conservator (financial manager) of an estate argued that the two-year statute of limitations for filing suit under the ftca should not have begun to run until she had access to the depositions of federal employees without which she could not have been aware of her claim against the federal government. as in wong, the federal government claimed that this statute of limitations was “jurisdictional,” and thus not subject to equitable tolling. the district court agreed with the federal government and dismissed the suit. the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed and held that equitable tolling was appropriate based on its earlier opinion inwong v. beebe."

the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit found that although the fcc did “ostensibly” consider this issue, its analysis was “so insubstantial” that it cannot provide a “reliable foundation” for the fcc’s conclusions. as such, the third circuit vacated the bulk of the agency’s actions over the past three years as arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the administrative procedure act."

188	"terrence byrd was driving on a divided four-lane highway near harrisburg, pennsylvania, when he was pulled over allegedly for violating a state law requiring drivers to use the left lane for passing only. recognizing the car as a rental car, the officers asked byrd for his license and rental agreement, which he had difficulty locating. once he did locate them, the officers noted that the rental agreement did not list byrd as an authorized driver, and when they ran his identification, they noted that he was using an alias and had an outstanding warrant in new jersey. despite the warrant’s indication that it did not request extradition from other jurisdictions, the officers attempted to contact authorities in new jersey to confirm they did not seek byrd’s arrest and extradition, allegedly following protocol for such situations. the officers experienced difficulty with their communications, however, and returned to byrd’s car, where they asked him to exit the vehicle and about his warrant and alias.
the officers asked whether byrd had anything illegal in the car and then requested byrd’s consent to search the car, noting that they did not actually need his consent because he was not listed on the rental agreement. the officers allege that byrd gave his consent, but byrd disputes this contention. the subsequent search turned up heroin and body armor in the trunk of the car.
at trial, byrd moved to suppress the evidence, challenging the initial stop, the extension of the stop, and the search. the district court determined that the violation of the traffic law justified the initial stop and that the extension of the stop was justified by the officers’ developing reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. byrd maintains that he did not consent to the search, so the issue remains whether he needed to consent at all—that is, whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle, despite not being listed on the rental agreement. if he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, then the officers’ search of the vehicle did not require his consent.
there is a circuit split as to whether an unlisted driver of a rental car has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle, and the third circuit (where the district court in this case sits) has held that such a driver does not. thus, the district court denied byrd’s motion to suppress, and the third circuit, reviewing the factual questions for clear error and the legal question de novo, affirmed the judgment of the district court."

the doi assistant secretary rejected bp's arguments and ruled for the government. a district court affirmed the decision, ruling that an agency administrative order was not a government action for monetary damages, so the statute of limitations did not apply. on appeal, the court of appeals for the d.c. circuit upheld the lower court's ruling. the circuit court ruled that the government would have had to file a complaint in court in order for the statute of limitations to take effect; an agency administrative order did not activate the time limit."

hayes' strategy was a success, as the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed the district court. the court held that conviction of a misdemeanor battery does not qualify as a crime of domestic violence, noting that the legislative intent and plain meaning of the statute indicated that the original offense must involve a ""domestic"" relationship between the victim and offender. finding this requirement unfulfilled in the case, the fourth circuit reversed hayes' conviction."

201	"hector ayala, a hispanic man, was charged with three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder stemming from a failed robbery. during jury selection for his trial in california state court, the prosecution used seven preemptory challenges to exclude each black or hispanic prospective juror. ayala challenged the prosecution's use of preemptory challenges as a violation of the supreme court's decision in batson v. kentucky, which held that the exclusion of jurors on the basis of race was a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. in accordance with batson, if a party can make a prima facie showing that preemptory challenges are being used in a racially motivated way, the other party must give a non-racially motivated reason for their use of the preemptory challenges. the state court allowed the prosecution to give their non-racially motivated reasons in a closed hearing, from which ayala and his attorneys were excluded, and subsequently found the prosecution's use of preemptory challenges was not racially motivated. ayala was not given the prosecution's reasoning or a transcript of the meeting until after the conclusion of his trial. additionally, after the trial it was discovered that the vast majority of the questionnaires all the potential jurors had to fill out had been lost. ayala was found guilty of the majority of the charges against him and sentenced to death.
on appeal, the california supreme court found that the state court erred in excluding ayala from the batson hearing, but that error as well as the loss of the questionnaires were harmless, and therefore upheld ayala's conviction. ayala appealed to the u.s court of appeals for the ninth circuit and argued that the batson hearing procedure and loss of the questionnaires violated his constitutional rights. in accordance with the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996, the appellate court found that the california supreme court had not adjudicated ayala's claims of federal constitutional violations on the merits largely on the basis that the california court had determined the procedure used for the batson hearing violated california state law; therefore the appellate court reviewed ayala's claims de novo and found that the exclusion of ayala from the batson hearing, as well as the loss of the questionnaires, violated ayala's constitutional rights. to determine whether the errors were harmless, the court of appeals applied the standard set forth in  brecht v. abrahamson , which asked whether the errors had a substantial and injurious influence on the jury's verdict, and found that the exclusion of ayala from the batson  hearing deprived him of the ability to prevail on a compelling batson challenge."

205	"a tennessee state court convicted archie biggers in the rape of margaret beamer.  the only major evidence against him was ms. beamer’s identification several weeks after the incident at a police station “show up”.  the “show up” was similar to a line up, but contained the suspect alone.  the police officer also had the suspect say phrases ms. beamer heard her attacker say on the night of the rape.  ms. beamer said she had “no doubt” that biggers was her attacker.  the tennessee supreme court upheld the conviction.  the u.s. supreme court affirmed by an equally divided court.
biggers then filed a writ of habeas corpus, which the district court granted, holding that the supreme court affirming by an equally divided court did not bar the writ.  the court also held that the “show up” procedure was so suggestive that it violated due process.  the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed."

206	"frank spisak was convicted of murder in an ohio state court and sentenced to death. subsequently, he was granted partial habeas corpus relief by the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit. the court held that mr. spisak received ineffective counsel at sentencing and the jury instructions at this phase unconstitutionally required the jury to be unanimous when finding mitigating evidence to his sentence. the court ordered a new sentencing trial. the supreme court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of musladin and landrigan.
on remand, the sixth circuit reinstated its original holding. it reasoned that musladin and landrigan were readily distinguishable from mr. spisak's case and therefore he was still entitled to habeas corpus relief. moreover, the court noted that although the supreme court had not ruled on a set of facts identical to those in mr. spisak's case, the court of appeals was not precluded from finding that the ohio state court had unreasonably applied federal law."

the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) promulgated three different orders granting extensions of the small refinery exemption, but these orders were not made publicly available. a group of renewable fuels producers challenged the orders, alleging that the orders exceeded the epa’s statutory authority. the tenth circuit agreed, finding that a small refinery may obtain an exemption only when it had received uninterrupted, continuous extensions of the exemption for every year since 2011."

208	"shirley jones was a professional actress and california resident whose television career was also based in california. marty ingels, her husband, was also a professional entertainer. on october 9, 1979, the national enquirer published an article about jones. john south wrote the first draft of the article, and his byline appeared on it. shortly before publication, south called ingels to read him the article and elicit his comments on it. ian calder, the president and editor of the enquirer, declined to print a retraction.
national enquirer, inc. was a corporation that published a national newspaper with a total circulation of over five million, 600,000 copies of which were sold in california. john south was a reporter for the enquirer. he was a resident of florida, but frequently travelled to california on business. ian calder was a florida resident and he exerted close control over the functions of the enquirer; he had traveled to california only twice and had no other relevant contacts with that state.
jones filed an action in california state court against calder and south, alleging that the article was untrue, libelous, and that it damaged their reputations and good names. the superior court ruled that although the injury occurred in california, it lacked personal jurisdiction over the claim because of the potential chilling effect from requiring editors and reporters to appear in remote jurisdictions. the california court of appeals reversed because the defendants intended to cause tortious injury to jones and ingels in california. a timely petition for appeal to the supreme court of california was denied, but the supreme court of the united states treated it as a petition for a writ of certiorari, granting review."

in response to perceived abuses of the class-action vehicle in securities litigation, congress had passed the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, which placed restrictions on federal securities fraud class actions. when plaintiffs began avoiding the law by bringing the suits in state courts instead of federal courts, congress passed the securities litigation uniform standards act of 1998 (slusa), which pre-empts federal class action securities fraud claims brought under state law that allege misrepresentation ""in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.""
merrill lynch argued that dabit's suit was pre-empted by slusa and therefore could not be brought under state law. dabit countered that the suit alleged misrepresentation concerning only the holding of stocks, and therefore was beyond the scope of slusa. the district court for the southern district of new york ruled for merrill lynch, finding the language of slusa broad enough to include suits such as dabit's. the second circuit court of appeals reversed, holding that suits by holders of stocks are distinct from suits by sellers and purchasers and that slusa was meant to pre-empt only the latter."

(state farm) was one of these companies that administered such policies in the gulf coast area. cori rigsby was a state farm claims adjuster who believed that state farm was wrongfully seeking to maximize its policyholders’ flood damage claims and minimize wind damage claims after hurricane katrina. rigsby sued state farm under the false claims act (fca). the district court determined that state farm had submitted false claims in violation of the fca. on appeal, state farm argued rigsby had violated the fca’s seal requirement, which stated that the complaint cannot be disclosed until the court orders the complaint served on the defendant, and that violation of the fca seal requirement warrants immediate dismissal. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit held that, although rigsby violated the seal requirement by disclosing the existence of the suit, the violation of the seal requirement does not warrant immediate dismissal.

234	"william dick was a 47-year-old farmer and experienced hunter who lived with his wife blanche on a farm near englevale, north dakota. william had two life insurance policies issued by the new york life insurance company, a new york corporation, payable to his wife. each contained a double indemnity clause preventing payment if william's death resulted from “self-destruction, whether sane or insane.” on january 20, 1955, between 10:30 and 11:00 am, blanche entered the farm’s silage shed and found her husband lying on his back. she saw a wound on his head and knew he was dead; william's double-barreled shotgun was lying near his body.
the county sheriff later determined that the shotgun was held about eighteen inches from william's body with the stock toward the feet and the barrel along the body when it was fired. he also determined that the gun likely did not fire from a person jarring, pounding, or dropping it, although there was also evidence that the gun had occasionally discharged accidentally in the past. dr. veitch, the county coroner, found another wound in william's chest, but determined that it was the wound to william's head that caused his immediate death; the chest wound likely only resulted in a great deal of pain. dr. veitch, who was also william's personal physician, testified that william had mild to moderate non-specific prostatitis, which left him tired but did not prevent him from doing farm work. william did not apparently leave a suicide note or mention suicide to his relatives or friends. in connection with blanche's later claim for benefits, however, dr. veitch listed the cause of death as “suicide.”
new york life insurance filed an action in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, claiming that william committed suicide. under north dakota law, proof of insurance coverage and death by gunshot wound shifted the burden to the insurer to prove that the death was not accidental. the jury found for blanche dick and awarded $7,500 in damages. on appeal, the united states court of appeals, eighth circuit, reviewed the evidence and determined that the shotgun could not have fired unless someone or something pushed or pulled one of the triggers. it further concluded that the evidence could not be reconciled with any reasonable theory that the shooting was accidental, given william's experience as a hunter and the multiple gunshot wounds on his body."

in 2013, welch filed a collateral challenge to his conviction and argued that his prior conviction for strong arm robbery vague and that his trial counsel had been ineffective in allowing him to be sentenced under the acca. he sought a certificate of appealability to the appellate court, which the district court denied. welch then sought a certificate of appealability from the appellate court and noted that there was a challenge to the acca based on its vagueness pending in the supreme court, johnson v. united states. the appellate denied the certificate of appealability.
three weeks later, the supreme court decided johnson v. united states and held that the residual clause of the acca, which included action that “otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another” in the definition of a violent felony, was unconstitutionally vague. the court held that the residual clause violated the due process clauses of the fifth amendment and fourteenth amendments because it was so vague that it failed to give people adequate notice of the conduct it punished. in order to apply the residual clause to a case, courts had to assess the “hypothetical risk posed by an abstract generic version” of the crime in question, which made the application of the clause unconstitutionally arbitrary and unpredictable."

a divided 5th circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling, upholding unit 1’s designation as critical habitat. the court rejected the landowners’ argument that the fws had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in making this designation on the theory that unit 1 was not presently habitable nor essential to species conservation. explaining that land need not be habitable to be considered “essential” under 16 u.s.c. § 1532(5)(a)(ii) of the endangered species act (esa), the court deferred to the agency’s interpretation of that term. the majority also held that the fws had not acted unreasonably in interpreting the esa to not contain a requirement that land be “currently” habitable by a species to be designated as critical habitat.
the 5th circuit also held that the fws had not made an arbitrary and capricious decision under 16 u.s.c. § 1533(b)(2) in not excluding unit 1 from the critical habitat based on economic impacts, and that this determination was not reviewable in federal court. "	True

using the reasoning from the atkins case, the missouri court decided, 6-to-3, that the u.s. supreme court's 1989 decision in stanford v. kentucky, which held that executing minors was not unconstitutional, was no longer valid. the opinion in stanford v. kentucky had relied on a finding that a majority of americans did not consider the execution of minors to be cruel and unusual. the missouri court, citing numerous laws passed since 1989 that limited the scope of the death penalty, held that national opinion had changed. finding that a majority of americans were now opposed to the execution of minors, the court held that such executions were now unconstitutional.
on appeal to the u.s. supreme court, the government argued that allowing a state court to overturn a supreme court decision by looking at ""evolving standards"" would be dangerous, because state courts could just as easily decide that executions prohibited by the supreme court (such as the execution of the mentally ill in atkins v. virginia) were now permissible due to a change in the beliefs of the american people."

the district court held that pom wonderful's claims regarding the name and label of the juice were barred by a separate law, the food, drug and cosmetics act (fdca). the fdca allows the food and drug administration (fda) to regulate the labels on, among other items, juices. because the fda has exclusive authority to file claims for violations of the fdca, the court feared that a decision under the lanham act would undercut the fda's authority to regulate juice labels. after both parties gathered evidence, the court granted summary judgment in favor of coca-cola on the name and label issues. although the court gave pom wonderful the opportunity to proceed to trial on the remaining issues, pom wonderful conceded that it could not win without the name and label issues. pom wonderful appealed.

based on this line of reasoning, quality stores filed for a refund from the internal revenue service (irs). the irs did not respond to quality stores' request for a refund, neither by allowing the claim nor denying it, and quality stores sued the irs. the federal district court agreed with quality stores' view on severance payments. the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed the district court and held that severance pay satisfies the elements congress set out to determine sub payments, which therefore makes such payments exempt from fica taxes."

373	"mark a. sveen and kaye l. melin were married in 1997. sveen purchased a life insurance policy that year, and the following year he named melin the primary beneficiary, and his children the contingent beneficiaries. sveen and melin divorced in 2007, and sveen died in 2011. 
minnesota had changed its probate code in 2002 to apply a revocation-upon-divorce statute to life insurance beneficiary designations. sveen had never changed the designation on his life insurance policy, and melin was therefore still listed as the primary beneficiary at the time of his death. 
the insurance company filed an interpleader to establish whether the revocation-upon-divorce statute nullified this designation. sveen’s children and melin cross-claimed for the proceeds, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the children, rejecting melin’s contention that retroactively applying the revocation-upon-divorce statute violated the contract clause of the constitution.
the eighth circuit reversed and remanded, finding that under its own precedent, the dispositive issue in this context was the right of the policyholder to have his wishes carried out in accordance with his intentions at the time he signed the contract. applying the revocation-upon-divorce statute retroactively would deprive him of that right in violation of the contract clause."

the sacketts sought a hearing with the epa to challenge the finding that the parcel is subject to the cwa. the epa did not grant the sacketts a hearing and continued to assert cwa jurisdiction over the parcel. the sacketts filed suit in the u.s. district court for the district of idaho seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. they challenged the compliance order as (1) arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act; (2) issued without a hearing in violation of the sacketts' procedural due process rights; and (3) issued on the basis of an ""any information available"" standard that is unconstitutionally vague. the district court granted the epa's motion to dismiss, finding that the cwa precludes judicial review of compliance orders before epa has started an enforcement action in federal court. on appeal, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the lower court order."

one month later, the superintendent of the school district recommended that the board not renew doyle’s contract, along with the contracts of nine other teachers.  the board adopted the superintendent’s recommendations. in response to doyle’s request for an explanation, the board stated that doyle displayed a “lack of tact in handling professional matters,” and cited both the call to the disc jockey and the obscene gestures doyle made toward students. doyle brought a § 1331 federal question action against the board for reinstatement with damages, claiming that the board’s refusal to rehire him violated his rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.

383	"on august 5, 2008, joel perez and carlos cruz drove to a shell station in arlington heights, illinois, with cruz at the wheel. they met with alejandro diaz, who was working with drug enforcement agency (""dea"") officials. diaz instructed them to meet him at a different location to complete the deal. instead, perez walked to a nearby denny's, where alexander vasquez waited for him in the driver's seat of a black pontiac bonneville. perez got into the passenger seat of the bonneville and called cruz, telling him that he was not willing to follow diaz. cruz walked to the denny's where he was introduced to vasquez. diaz called cruz to ask why they were not following him. cruz informed him that they wanted to complete the deal in the denny's parking lot, telling him, ""we got the money here."" vasquez echoed this statement.
diaz contacted his dea handler, agent james chupik. law enforcement agents surrounded the parking lot in their vehicles; several officers approached the bonneville to arrest vasquez, cruz, and perez. cruz, outside the car, raised his hands in surrender. vasquez, however, immediately put the bonneville into reverse, striking two squad cars. he then shifted gears and headed for an agent. agent chupik stepped in front of the bonneville and commanded vasquez to stop, but was forced to dive out of the way. the bonneville headed west on the eastbound lanes of algonquin road.
several minutes later, police found the bonneville abandoned in a walmart parking lot. a bystander told the police that he saw two men run from the vehicle into a mcdonald's. vasquez and perez ran into the mcdonald's, through its kitchen, then split up. arlington heights police officers quickly apprehended them, however. they found a cell phone on vasquez and several cell phones on the ground near perez; records indicated several calls between vasquez's cell phone and both phones apparently belonging to perez. police impounded the bonneville, and later found $23,000 in cash hidden in a secret compartment.
a federal grand jury indicted vasquez with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine and with attempting to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine. at trial, agent chupik testified that he instructed diaz to have cruz and his ""customers"" meet diaz at a gas station in arlington heights. in a transcript of the call between cruz and diaz, however, cruz only referred to a single customer. vasquez's counsel attempted to impeach agent chupik on this point, but the judge found the difference to be trivial, limiting vasquez's right to cross-examination and to refresh agent chupik's memory with the transcript. the government introduced vasquez's previous drug conviction into evidence to demonstrate vasquez's intent; he was convicted for dealing drugs with perez in 2002.
vasquez called perez's wife marina as a witness to testify. marina perez testified that she called vasquez before the events in question to ask him to pick up joel perez at the site of the failed drug deal, implying that vasquez was there by coincidence. in response, the government introduced transcripts and audio recordings of conversations between marina perez and her husband as evidence of bias. these indicated that marina perez spoke to her husband about a possible plea deal; marina perez also mentioned that vasquez's attorney had told her that, ""everybody is going to lose."" the trial judge allowed these transcripts and recordings to be admitted to show marina perez's bias and for the truth of their contents.
the jury found vasquez guilty on the charge of conspiracy but not guilty on the charge of attempting to possess cocaine.
the u.s. court of appeals, seventh circuit, held that vasquez's previous drug conviction was properly introduced into evidence. the court rejected vasquez's claim that the police's search of the bonneville violated his fourth amendment rights, noting that vasquez abandoned the car, and that the police had probable cause to believe that the money for the drug transaction was in the bonneville. the court also rejected vasquez's claim that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to elicit testimony through the cross-examination of agent chupik. the trial court found the distinction between ""customers"" and ""customer"" to be trivial, and the court held this finding to be within the trial court's discretion.
in a split decision, the court turned to the testimony of marina perez, holding that the evidence of conversations between marina perez and vasquez's counsel were properly admitted to show bias and inconsistency with prior statements. while noting that the judge improperly instructed the jury that the recordings could be considered as evidence of the truthfulness of their contents, it held this instruction to be a harmless error. it pointed to other overwhelming evidence of vasquez's guilt, including his attempt to escape capture and his previous conviction for drug dealing. it held that the jury would have convicted vasquez absent the introduction of the transcripts and recordings in question.
judge david hamilton dissented on this point alone, describing the recordings as prejudicial and inadmissible. he reminded the majority that the error is only harmless if the court is convinced vasquez would have been convicted absent the error. he used a different test than the majority, looking to whether or not the error contributed to the conviction. he noted that vasquez was never directly recorded or mentioned by name in any of the recordings, and that government agents were not aware of his involvement until his arrest. judge hamilton argued that marina perez' testimony about vasquez was thus plausible evidence of innocence without the recordings on record."

406	under the foreign trade antitrust improvements act of 1982 (ftaia), the sherman act (which regulates monopolies and attempts to unfairly raise prices) does not apply to foreign commerce unless that commerce significantly harms domestic commerce, american imports, or american exporters. in this case, several companies that purchase and resell vitamins sued several vitamin manufacturers for illegal attempts to raise prices, both within the united states and in foreign countries. the manufacturers asked the district judge to dismiss several of the vitamin purchasers from the case because they only did business in other countries and, the manufacturers argued, could therefore not bring claims under the sherman act. the purchasers countered that the foreign price-fixing attempts were linked to the domestic attempts and could therefore be heard under the exception to the ftaia. the district court sided with the manufacturers. on appeal, a d.c. circuit court of appeals panel reversed, finding that the price fixing schemes were independent of each other but that congress' intent had been to prevent price-fixing both at home and abroad, and that even the foreign claims could therefore be brought under the exception to the ftaia.

407	"in august 2000, vonlee nicole titlow helped his aunt billie rogers murder his wealthy uncle donald rogers. after titlow was charged with first-degree murder, the prosecution offered him a plea bargain. in exchange for testifying against billie rogers, titlow could plead guilty to manslaughter and receive a reduced sentence. after consulting with his attorney, titlow accepted the deal. however, before sentencing, titlow spoke to a sheriff's deputy who suggested that he withdraw his guilty plea and consult another attorney. titlow followed the deputy's advice, hired a new attorney and withdrew his guilty plea.
following his trial, a jury convicted titlow of second-degree murder and sentenced him to 20-to-40 years in prison. this led titlow to accuse his second attorney of ineffective assistance of counsel for allowing him to withdraw the original guilty plea. both the trial court and the michigan court of appeals rejected titlow's claim. titlow petitioned the michigan supreme court to hear his case, but they refused to do so.
titlow then petitioned for federal habeas corpus relief, but the district court denied his claim as well. the district court held that titlow failed to meet the standard for overturning a state-court conviction under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act (""aedpa""). the court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed the lower court's decision and ordered the state to reoffer titlow's original plea agreement. the appellate court held that titlow's second attorney was ineffective for failing to investigate his claims further, failing to obtain documents from the first attorney, and failing to convince titlow to take the plea bargain."

409	"rudolf ivanovich abel maintained an artist’s studio in brooklyn heights, new york while living in new york at various inexpensive lodgings. in early may of 1957, reino hayhanen informed the american embassy in paris that he had been acting as a secret agent for the soviet union in the united states since 1952. he also informed the embassy that he had assisted a soviet agent he only knew as “mark”, whom he identified as a resident agent in the united states with the military rank of colonel. federal bureau of investigation (“fbi”) agents began a long investigation of abel, but did not seek to obtain a warrant of arrest or a search warrant relating to abel.
fbi agents gave three agents from the immigration and naturalization service (“ins”) a report on abel as a suspected spy; the fbi agents also asked them to prepare an immigration detention warrant. on june 21, 1957, fbi agents found abel at the latham hotel in manhattan and questioned him unsuccessfully for a half hour. a short time later, ins agents who were waiting outside packed up all of abel’s personal effects in the room. they seized over two hundred items but found no weapons or evidence of alienage; the fbi also seized several items after an agent checked abel out of the hotel, including three items contested at trial.
two ins agents flew abel to a maximum security camp in mcallen, texas, where fbi and ins agents interrogated him for four weeks. on the third day, he admitted he was in the united states illegally. a criminal warrant for abel’s arrest was issued on august 7, 1957 while abel was in his texas cell; he also learned that same day that he was indicted for espionage. agents brought abel back to new york, where the district court tried and convicted him of espionage. the prosecution introduced seven items seized before the government obtained a search warrant. the united states court of appeals, second circuit, affirmed abel’s conviction, holding that ins agents could search abel’s hotel room incident to his valid arrest and pursuant to a deportation arrest warrant."

412	in 1964, the federal government sued several corporations for rigging prices of concrete and steel pipes in violation of the sherman act. that case reached a final judgment in may 1968, when all parties agreed to terms that prevented the companies from engaging in future violations of anti-trust laws. eleven days short of one year after this agreement, the state of utah, on behalf of several agencies and local governments, filed a class action lawsuit against the same corporations. the lawsuit claimed that the corporations’ previous price fixing schemes had directly injured the state and other plaintiffs. six months later, the corporations successfully argued that, under the federal rules of civil procedure, the lawsuit could not be maintained as a class action because it was not impractical for the plaintiffs to each have individual representation. eight days following this ruling, over 60 towns, municipalities, and water districts within the state of utah immediately filed motions to intervene in the lawsuit. the court denied their motions because they had failed to argue them within the one-year time statute of limitations required under federal law. the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed. first, that court held that, by filing lawsuit as a class action, all of the claims were adequately before the trial court before the statute of limitations was reached. however, because the judge dismissed the class action after the statute of limitations ran, the parties were unable to re-file their claims against the corporations. that court held that the trial judge could not leave the plaintiff’s without recourse after the time to file the lawsuit had passed. instead, the plaintiffs should have the eleven days that remained under the statute of limitations when the initial lawsuit was filed in order to intervene or otherwise file individual claims. the corporations appealed.

413	in 1995, montana enacted the parental notice of abortion act, which prohibits a physician from performing an abortion on a minor unless the physician has notified one of the minor's parents or legal guardian 48 hours in advance. the act provides for a waiver, or judicial bypass, of the notification requirement under certain circumstances, including if the notification of a parent or guardian was not in the best interests of the minor. several physicians challenged the statute's validity. the federal district court, asserting that a parental notice requirement must be waived whenever an abortion would be in the minor's best interests, ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. in affirming, the court of appeals ruled that a judicial bypass based on the consideration of a minor's best interests only with respect to the possible consequences of parental notification was constitutionally impermissible, in that the bypass did not sufficiently protect the right of minors to have an abortion.

in 2006, congress passed the military commissions act of 2006 (mca). the act eliminates federal courts' jurisdiction to hear habeas applications from detainees who have been designated (according to procedures established in the detainee treatment act of 2005) as enemy combatants. when the case was appealed to the d.c. circuit for the second time, the detainees argued that the mca did not apply to their petitions, and that if it did, it was unconstitutional under the suspension clause. the suspension clause reads: ""the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.""
the d.c. circuit ruled in favor of the government on both points. it cited language in the mca applying the law to ""all cases, without exception"" that pertain to aspects of detention. one of the purposes of the mca, according to the circuit court, was to overrule the supreme court's opinion in hamdan v. rumsfeld, which had allowed petitions like boumediene's to go forward. the d.c. circuit held that the suspension clause only protects the writ of habeas corpus as it existed in 1789, and that the writ would not have been understood in 1789 to apply to an overseas military base leased from a foreign government. constitutional rights do not apply to aliens outside of the united states, the court held, and the leased military base in cuba does not qualify as inside the geographic borders of the u.s. in a rare reversal, the supreme court granted certiorari after initially denying review three months earlier."

in order to show that a government official is not entitled to qualified immunity, a plaintiff is required to prove that the official violated a clearly established constitutional right. the eleventh circuit ruled that scott's actions constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the fourth amendment. because there was no imminent threat - harris remained in control of his vehicle and the roads were relatively empty - scott's use of deadly force was unconstitutional. although no appellate court had ruled on the specific question of the use of deadly force in a high-speed chase, the eleventh circuit ruled that the limits on deadly force were ""clearly established."""

the police arrested pointer and lloyd earl dillard and took them before a state judge for a preliminary hearing; the state charged them with robbing phillips of $375 by assault, violence, or by putting in fear of life or bodily injury, in violation of texas law. an assistant attorney general conducted the prosecution and examined witnesses, but neither of the defendants had a lawyer. dillard tried to cross-examine phillips, but pointer did not.
pointer was indicted on the robbery charge. at trial, pointer testified on his own behalf, denying his alleged role in the robbery and swearing he had never been in the 7-11 store. the state offered a transcript of phillips' testimony as evidence because phillips had since moved out of texas and did not intend to return. the defense objected to the use of the transcript as a denial of pointer's right to confront a witness. the trial judge overruled because pointer was present at the preliminary hearing, and pointer was convicted. the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed his conviction, rejecting pointer's claim that the use of the transcript violated his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments."

the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit has repeatedly rejected claims that the treaty provision at issue exempts members from taxes or state fees on commercial activities taking place outside the yakama indian reservation. in the instant case, the washington supreme court adopted a much broader meaning, ruling that this portion of the treaty bars states from taxing ""any trade, traveling, and importation"" by members of the yakama tribe “that requires the use of public roads,” even those outside the reservation. based on this interpretation, the state’s high court held that the treaty preempts the state from requiring cougar den to pay wholesale fuel taxes."

in brady v. maryland the u.s. supreme court held that due process is violated if prosecutors suppress evidence favorable to a defendant that relates to guilt or punishment. pointing to brady and evidence the prosecution suppressed information on its ties to the two witnesses, banks sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court to overturn his conviction and get a new trial. the district court granted habeas relief with respect to banks' death sentence based on the state's failure to disclose farr's informant status. however the district court refused to reverse the guilt verdict, rejecting banks' brady claim relating to cook's testimony and banks' argument that federal rule of civil procedure 15(b) allowed the claim to be treated as if it were raised earlier.
the fifth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court's decision to grant banks relief as to his death sentence based on his brady claim relating to farr's testimony. the court held that banks first had to press his claims in state court. the court upheld the district court's rejection of banks' claim relating to cook's testimony, holding that federal rule of civil procedure 15(b) does not apply to habeas proceedings."

474	in 1911, u.s. senator a. o. bacon conveyed land to the city of macon, georgia through a testamentary trust for the purpose of providing a park for white persons only.  the city operated the park in that manner, but after passage of the fourteenth amendment, people of all races were permitted to use the park.  the managers of the park attempted to have the city removed as the trustee because it could no longer legally enforce racial segregation.  the u.s. supreme court ruled in favor of african american citizens who intervened, holding that the public nature of the park required that it be treated as a public institution subject to the fourteenth amendment regardless of who owned the park.  the trustees of bacon’s estate then moved for a ruling that the trust was unenforceable, because racial segregation was no longer permitted, so the property should revert to bacon’s heirs.  the trial court granted the motion, holding that racial segregation was an integral part of the trust, so the court could not simply amend the trust.  the supreme court of georgia affirmed.

475	board no. 47, louisville, kentucky, denied the application of cassius clay, also known as muhammad ali, for classification as a conscientious objector. clay then took an administrative appeal to the kentucky appeal board, which tentatively classified him i-a, or eligible for unrestricted military service, and referred his file to the justice department for an advisory recommendation. the justice department concluded, contrary to a hearing officer's recommendation, that clay's claim should be denied. the department wrote that clay did not meet any of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status; that he is conscientiously opposed to war in any form, that this opposition is based upon religious training and belief, and that this objection is sincere. subsequently, the appeal board denied clay's claim, but without stating its reasons. when clay refused to report for induction, he was tried and convicted of willful refusal to submit to induction. the court of appeals affirmed.

476	"in the telecommunications act of 1996, congress declared that payphone service providers (psps) must be compensated for every completed call using their payphones. previously, psps were not compensated for coinless ""dial-around"" long-distance calls in which the caller pays a long distance carrier rather than the psp. the federal communications commission (fcc) adopted rules requiring the carriers to pay the psps on a per-call basis. metrophones telecommunications, a psp, sued global crossing telecommunications, a long-distance carrier, alleging that global crossing had failed to pay for calls placed from metrophones's payphones.
the district court dismissed metrophones's first complaint because the telecommunications act of 1996 did not create a private right of action to recover compensation from long-distance carriers. metrophones then filed an amended complaint based on section 201(b) of the communications act of 1934, which deals with ""unjust and unreasonable"" practices of carriers. global communications argued that metrophones had no right to sue under this statute either, but the district court disagreed and ruled for metrophones.
the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed this decision. the circuit court relied heavily on the fcc's interpretation of the statute, which was that failure to pay compensation to psps is an ""unjust and unreasonable"" practice in violation of section 201(b) and that psps have a private right of action to sue carriers for such violations. the circuit court held that though the fcc rule on the subject was brief, it was entitled to deference from the courts in the absence of specific guidance from the statute."

hernández’s parents filed a lawsuit against the officer and various other defendants alleging violation of their son’s fourth and fifth amendment rights. the district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, and the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed and part and reversed in part. the fifth circuit held that hernández lacked fourth amendment rights, but his parents were entitled to a remedy under bivens v. six unknown named agents, 403 u.s. 388 (1971) (holding an implied cause of action against federal government officials who have violated the plaintiff’s constitutional rights), and the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity. on rehearing en banc, the full fifth circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the parents’ claims, holding that they had failed to state a claim for a violation of the fourth amendment and that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not “clearly established” that it was unconstitutional for an officer on u.s. soil to shoot a mexican national on mexican soil.
the u.s. supreme court granted certiorari in 2016 and reversed the en banc fifth circuit as to qualified immunity. the court remanded the case so the lower court could determine whether the shooting violated hernández’s fourth amendment rights and whether his parents could assert claims for damages under bivens. on remand, the en banc fifth circuit once again affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the complaint, holding that the excessive force claim was unlike any that had been decided previously and thus the plaintiffs were not entitled to any remedy under bivens. in so holding, the fifth circuit applied the supreme court’s decision in ziglar v. abbasi, 582 u.s. __ (2017), in which the court held that for a new type of claim to be cognizable under bivens, there must be some special factor makes the judiciary better suited than the legislature to recognize such a claim.

in response, the delaware valley citizens’ council for clean air (dvccca) brought suit against pennsylvania and the environmental protection agency. the epa filed a separate action against pennsylvania and dvccca dropped its charges against the epa. on august 29, 1978, pennsylvania, penn der and the pennsylvania department of transportation (penn dot) agreed to a final consent decree, terminating the dvccca and epa actions.

the caa provided that in issuing a final order in any action brought under the caa, the court may award the costs of litigation to any party whenever the court determines such an award is appropriate. the dvccca and the epa consequently sought attorneys’ fees and costs for all activity performed after the court issued the consent decree on august 29, 1978. the district court awarded attorneys’ fees that included time spent by plaintiffs’ attorneys monitoring pennsylvania’s performance under the consent decree, an award for “superior quality” while opposing the state’s motion to stay the consent decree, and work performed for hearings held before the epa.  it also awarded a multiplier for the arguably small likelihood of plaintiffs’ success in three phases of the litigation. the united states court of appeals for the third circuit affirmed the attorneys’ fees awarded by the district court."
